Business.Our MissionImprove people\u2019s lives with the world\u2019s best transportation.OverviewLyft,  Inc  (the  \u201cCompany\u201d  or  \u201cLyft\u201d)  started  a  movement  to  revolutionize  transportation.  In  2012,  we  launched  our  peer-to-peer  marketplace  for  on-demandridesharing and have continued to pioneer innovations aligned with our mission. Today, Lyft is one of the largest multimodal transportation networks in the United Statesand Canada.We believe that the world is at the beginning of a shift away from car ownership to Transportation-as-a-Service (\u201cTaaS\u201d). Lyft is at the forefront of this massivesocietal change. Our ridesharing marketplace connects drivers with riders via the Lyft mobile application (the \u201cLyft App\u201d) in cities across the United States and in selectcities in Canada. We believe that our ridesharing marketplace allows riders to use their cars less and offers a viable alternative to car ownership while providing driversusing our platform the freedom and independence to choose when, where, how long and on what platforms they work. As this evolution continues, we believe there is amassive opportunity for us to improve the lives of riders by connecting them to more affordable and convenient transportation options.We are laser-focused on revolutionizing transportation. We have established a scaled network of users brought together by our robust technology platform (the\u201cLyft  Platform\u201d)  that  powers  rides  and  connections  every  day.  We  leverage  our  technology  platform,  the  scale  and  density  of  our  user  network  and  insights  from  asignificant number of rides to continuously improve our ridesharing marketplace efficiency and develop new offerings. We\u2019ve also taken steps to ensure our network iswell positioned to benefit from technological innovation in mobility.Today, our offerings include an expanded set of transportation modes in select cities, such as access to a network of shared bikes and scooters (\u201cLight Vehicles\u201d)for shorter rides and first-mile and last-mile legs of multimodal trips, information about nearby public transit routes, and Lyft Rentals, an offering for renters who want torent a car for a fixed period of time for personal use. We believe our transportation network offers a viable alternative to car ownership.We generate substantially all of our revenue from our ridesharing marketplace that connects drivers and riders. We collect service fees and commissions fromdrivers for their use of our ridesharing marketplace. As drivers accept more rider leads and complete more rides, we earn more revenue. We also generate revenue fromriders  renting  Light  Vehicles,  drivers  renting  vehicles  through  Express  Drive,  Lyft  Rentals  renters,  Lyft  Driver  Center  and  Lyft  Auto  Care  users,  and  by  making  ourridesharing marketplace  available  to organizations  through our Lyft Business offerings, such as our Concierge and Corporate Business Travel programs.  In the secondquarter of 2021, we began generating revenues from licensing and data access agreements, primarily with third-party autonomous vehicle companies.We  have  made  focused  and  substantial  investments  in  support  of  our  mission.  For  example,  to  continually  launch  new  innovations  on  our  platform,  we  haveinvested heavily in research and development and have completed multiple strategic acquisitions. We have also invested in sales and marketing to grow our community,cultivate a differentiated brand that resonates with drivers and riders and promote further brand awareness. Together, these investments have enabled us to create a powerfulmultimodal platform and scaled user network.Notwithstanding the impact of COVID-19, we are continuing to invest in the future, both organically and through acquisitions of complementary businesses. Wealso continue to invest in the expansion of our network of Light Vehicles and Lyft Autonomous, which focuses on the deployment and scaling of third-party self-drivingtechnology on the Lyft network. Our strategy is to always be at the forefront of transportation innovation, and we believe that through these investments, we will continueto be well positioned as a leader in TaaS. Even as we invest in the business, we also remain focused on finding ways to operate more efficiently.To advance our mission, we aim to build the defining brand of our generation and to advocate through our commitment to social and environmental responsibility.We  believe  that  our  brand  represents  freedom  at  your  fingertips:  freedom  from  the  stresses  of  car  ownership  and  freedom  to  do  and  see  more.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4640, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "faf3715c-5ff8-4088-a8b4-6ed95f3d28a1": {"__data__": {"id_": "faf3715c-5ff8-4088-a8b4-6ed95f3d28a1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "lyft_2021.pdf", "file_path": "/media/mtl/Volume F/PROJECTS/projects/Func_Call/pdf/lyft_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1440303, "creation_date": "2025-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3a8c0f78-2141-43fe-87cb-ad5a074e8a0d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "lyft_2021.pdf", "file_path": "/media/mtl/Volume F/PROJECTS/projects/Func_Call/pdf/lyft_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1440303, "creation_date": "2025-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-28"}, "hash": "684be9a6e5067e76368396c729cddaad1e2821ea2ef04263642293209e8c6a12", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ac5bb303-5962-4494-8a29-604336750ce9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "lyft_2021.pdf", "file_path": "/media/mtl/Volume F/PROJECTS/projects/Func_Call/pdf/lyft_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1440303, "creation_date": "2025-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-28"}, "hash": "48b506ba2666c879a1576a1e38fd5ee7e54611a39c8397c4262f4cc3d2c7d862", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Wealso continue to invest in the expansion of our network of Light Vehicles and Lyft Autonomous, which focuses on the deployment and scaling of third-party self-drivingtechnology on the Lyft network.

Since  the  pandemic  began  in  March  2020,governments  and  private  businesses  -  at  the  recommendation  of  public  health  officials  -  have  enacted  precautions  to  mitigate  the  spread  of  the  virus,  including  travelrestrictions  and  social  distancing  measures  in  many  regions  of  the  United  States  and  Canada,  and  many  enterprises  have  instituted  and  maintained  work  from  homeprograms and limited the number of employees on site. Beginning in the middle of March 2020, the pandemic and these related responses caused decreased demand for ourplatform leading to decreased revenues as well as decreased earning opportunities for drivers on our platform. Our business continues to be impacted by the COVID-19pandemic.Although we have seen some signs of demand improving, particularly compared to the demand levels at the start of the pandemic, demand levels continue to beaffected by the impact of variants and changes in case counts. The exact timing and pace of the recovery remain uncertain. The extent to which our operations will continueto be impacted by the pandemic will depend largely on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new informationwhich may emerge concerning COVID-19 variants and the severity of the pandemic and actions by government authorities and private businesses to contain the pandemicor recover from its impact, among other things. For example, an increase in cases due to variants of the virus has caused many businesses to delay employees returning tothe  office,  which  in  turn  reduces  levels  of  demand.  Even  as  travel  restrictions  and  shelter-in-place  orders  are  modified  or  lifted,  we  anticipate  that  continued  socialdistancing, altered consumer behavior, reduced travel and commuting, and expected corporate cost cutting will be significant challenges for us. The strength and duration ofthese challenges cannot be presently estimated.In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have adopted multiple measures, including, but not limited, to establishing new health and safety requirements forridesharing  and  updating  workplace  policies.  We  also  made  adjustments  to  our  expenses  and  cash  flow  to  correlate  with  declines  in  revenues  including  headcountreductions in 2020.For more information on risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and our litigation matters, see the section titled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in Item 1A of Part I.

This is a separateconsumer offering from Express Drive.\u2022Light Vehicles. We have a network of shared bikes and scooters (\u201cLight Vehicles\u201d) in a number of cities to address the needs of users who are looking for optionsthat are more active, usually lower-priced, and often more efficient for short trips during heavy traffic. These modes can also help supplement the first-mile andlast-mile of a multimodal trip with public transit.\u2022Public  Transit. Available  in  select  cities,  our  Transit  offering  integrates  third-party  public  transit  data  into  the  Lyft  App  to  offer  users  a  robust  view  oftransportation options around them and allows them to see transit routes to their destinations at no cost. Providing real-time public transit information is anotherstep toward providing effective, equitable and sustainable transportation to our communities, and creating a more seamless and connected transportation network.\u2022Lyft Autonomous. We  have a number of strategic partnerships that offer access to autonomous vehicles. Our Open Platform partnership with Motional (formerlyAptiv) has enabled the commercial  deployment of a fleet of autonomous vehicles on our platform in Las Vegas. In July 2021, we completed a multi-elementtransaction with Woven Planet, a subsidiary of Toyota Motor Corporation, for the divestiture of certain assets related to our self-driving vehicle division, Level 5,as  well  as  commercial  agreements  for  the  utilization  of  Lyft  rideshare  and  fleet  data  to  accelerate  the  safety  and  commercialization  of  the  automated-drivingvehicles that Woven Planet is developing. In December 2021, we launched an autonomous rideshare service in Miami with Ford and Argo AI, delivering on ashared commitment to deploy Ford\u2019s autonomous vehicles, powered by the Argo Self-Driving System, on our ridesharing network.We have established one of the largest transportation networks in the United States and Canada. While network scale is important, we recognize that transportationhappens locally and each market has its own unique user network. Our dynamic platform adjusts to the specific attributes of each market on a real-time basis.DriversThe drivers on our platform are active members of their communities. They are parents, students, business owners, retirees and everything in between.

In November 2018, we acquired Bikeshar e Holdings LLC (\u201cMotivate\u201d), the largest bike sharing platform inthe United States at the time and in February 2020, we acquired Flexdrive, LLC (\u201cFlexdrive\u201d), one of our longstanding Express Drive partners. We will continueto selectively  consider  acquisitions  that  contribute  to the  growth of our  current  business,  help  us expand  into  adjacent  markets  or  add new capabilities  to ournetwork. We believe drivers and riders will continue to benefit from a broad partner ecosystem that builds on our existing loyalty and reward programs. We havealso built strong relationships with transportation suppliers, state and local governments, and technology solutions providers and we intend to continue to pursuepartnerships that contribute to our growth.CompetitionThe market for TaaS networks is intensely competitive and characterized by rapid changes in technology, shifting rider needs and frequent introductions of newservices and offerings.

We expect thedemand for our transportation network may decline over the winter season and the demand for our network of Light Vehicles may increase during more temperate and dryseasons. Our business is also subject to risks related to COVID-19. In particular, travel bans and mobility restrictions have weighed on demand. Although we have seensome signs of demand improving as COVID-19 conditions have improved, particularly compared to the start of the pandemic, the exact timing and pace of the recoveryremain uncertain. We are unable to predict when and to what extent these public health and safety measures may be eased, how riders will respond to the easing of suchmeasures, as well as whether additional measures may need to be implemented in the future, any of which may continue to result in decreased demand notwithstandingusual seasonality.Our Brand and MarketingWe believe good energy moves the world.

Anyone who rates  a rider  or driver  three  stars  or fewer  will never  bematched with that individual again through the app.In 2021, we published our Community Safety Report, which is available on our website and details the frequency of some of the most serious safety incidents thatare reported to us, which are statistically very rare. From 2017 to 2019, over 99% of trips occurred without any reported safety incident, which accounted for 0.0002% of alltrips in this period.

As  of  December  31,  2021,  we  had  4,453  employees  inapproximately 119 offices and additional locations, including Driver Hubs, Driver Centers, and Service Desks. Approximately 40% of our employees work in our productmanagement, engineering, design and science organizations. Our employees are passionate about our mission to improve people\u2019s lives with the world\u2019s best transportation.We believe that achieving more diversity in workforce representation is an important priority. We are a company with a diverse customer base, and the more ouremployees reflect that diversity, the better we can serve our customers, ultimately making our business stronger. As of December 31, 2021, our employee base was 59%male and 39% female, and women represented 37% of our leadership overall. The ethnicity of our U.S. employees was 44% White, 30% Asian, 11% Hispanic or Latinx,8% Black, and 5% two or more races, American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander. Our employee gender and ethnicity information is basedon  self-identification,  and  employees  who  did  not  disclose  their  gender  or  ethnicity  have  been  excluded  from  the  applicable  disclosure.  As  of  December  31,  2021,employees who did not disclose gender represented approximately 2% of total employees, and employees who did not disclose ethnicity represented approximately 2% oftotal U.S. employees.We strive to build a more representative workforce which requires an intentional and comprehensive effort to reach and recruit outstanding candidates, developtalent internally, and open up pathways for advancement. We launched initiatives such as requiring all director level and above roles to consider at least one woman andone  Black  or  Latinx  candidate  at  the  onsite  interview  stage.  We  are  continuing  to  focus  on  scaling  and  sustaining  diverse  partnerships  and  early  candidate  pipelinedevelopment as we believe recruiting and hiring initiatives can yield short and long-term benefits to the organization.One of the most powerful examples of Lyft\u2019s devotion to inclusivity is our ongoing commitment to pay fairness. We conducted an annual pay equity audit for ourfifth consecutive year to assess for any systemic issues in our compensation. We worked with third party experts to conduct statistical tests on a majority of U.S. based teammembers\u2019  annual  salary,  equity  awards,  and  total  compensation  at  hire.  The  goal  was  to  identify  whether  any  statistically  significant  pay  differences  existed  betweendifferent demographic (gender and race) groups in the same band, level and job family. Where our analysis identified differences, we investigated, including looking atfactors not accounted for in the statistical models we used. In 2021, we did not find patterns of statistically significant pay differences for different gender or racial groupsafter accounting for legitimate business factors like performance, experience, and location.Given continued uncertainty and as we recognize our remote work policy must be broadened, we have given many employees the option to work from home.None of our employees are represented by a labor union.

Asanother step in the shift from personal car ownership, we\u2019ve also launched Lyft Pink, our premier membership program, which offers discounted pricing for rideshare,bikes, and scooters, in addition to perks for car rentals.We launched our national Resilient Streets Initiative in September 2020 and offered a vision for how cities can safely and efficiently move the greatest number ofpeople as economic, educational and social activities resume in our cities. The initiative reimagined what a \u201cresilient street corridor\u201d might look like in cities where Lyftoperates  micromobility  services.

This  is  in  line  with  the  Clean  Miles  Standard  and  Incentive  Program  which  was  approved  by  theCalifornia Air Resources Board in May 2021 and sets the target that ninety percent of rideshare miles in California must be in EVs by the end of 2030. The shift to 100%EVs will mean transitioning all vehicles used on the Lyft platform over the next decade to all-electric or other zero-emission technologies. This includes cars in ExpressDrive, Lyft Rentals, Lyft Autonomous, and personal cars used by drivers on the Lyft platform. Switching to EVs is not just good for the planet; it\u2019s good for people \u2013 riders,drivers, and the communities they serve.SocialWe approach working with our partners, cities and municipalities in a collaborative manner and seek to establish mutually beneficial relationships based on trust,respect and a common objective of improving people\u2019s lives by improving transportation. Through our LyftUp initiative, we\u2019re working to enable access to affordable,reliable transportation for all \u2014 no matter income or zip code. We built LyftUp to account for those still left behind. LyftUp aims to bridge some of the most seriousoutstanding transportation gaps. Through our LyftUp programs, we partner with leading organizations, including government agencies and nonprofits, to provide access tofree and discounted car, bike and scooter rides to individuals and families in need. LyftUp programs included:\u2022Jobs Access - provides rides to and from job interviews, job trainings and/or the first few weeks of a new job;\u2022Grocery Access - provides rides to and from the grocery store for families living in certain areas without sufficient grocery store access;\u2022Community Grants Program - awards ride credits to hyp erlocal nonprofit organizations across the country making a difference in their communities;\u2022Micromobility  Access -  provides  deeply  discounted  bikeshare  and  scooter-share  memberships  for  eligible  applicants  who  qualify  for  federal,  state  or  localassistance programs;\u2022Universal Vaccine Access Campaign -  mobilizes a coalition of partners to provide rides to and from COVID-19 vaccination sites for low-income, underinsuredand at-risk communities;\u2022Disaster Response - provides rides to access v ital services both leading up to and in the wake of disasters and other local emergencies when roads are safe to do so;and\u2022Voting Access - provides rides to the polls during Federal elections, with a focus on supporting individuals who traditionally face barriers to voting, such asseniors, veterans and communities of color.In response to the passage of Texas Senate Bill 8 (\u201cSB8\u201d) which raised concerns that drivers could be sued simply for transporting passengers, Lyft created aDriver Legal Defense Fund to cover 100% of legal fees for drivers sued under SB8 while driving on our platform. We also donated $1 million to Planned Parenthood tohelp ensure that transportation is never a barrier to healthcare access. Drivers using Lyft are never responsible for monitoring where their riders go or why. Similarly, ridersshould never have to justify or share where they are going or why.Corporate GovernanceOur board of directors regularly evaluates our corporate governance structure and processes to help steer the company's direction and ensure it is operating withthe utmost business integrity. More information about our directors, executive officers and corporate governance will be included in our definitive Proxy Statement for our2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.Corporate InformationWe were incorporated in 2007 as Bounder Web, Inc., a Delaware corporation.

This imbalance fluctuates for various reasons, and to the extent that driver availability is limited, our service levels have been and may be negativelyimpacted and we have increased prices or provided additional incentives and may need to continue to do so, which may adversely affect our business, financialcondition and results of operation.\u2022The responsive measures to the COVID-19 pandemic have caused us to modify our business practices by permitting corporate employees in nearly all of ourlocations  to  work  remotely,  limiting  employee  travel,  and  canceling,  postponing  or  holding  virtual  events  and  meetings.  We  may  be  required  to  or  choosevoluntarily to take additional actions for the health and safety of our workforce and users of our platform, including after the pandemic subsides and with respectto vaccination, whether in response to government orders or based on our own determinations of what is in the best interests of our employees or users of ourplatform. The effects of the pandemic, including permanent hybrid and remote working arrangements for employees, may also impact our real estate footprint,financial reporting systems and internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and may increase the risk of a cybersecurity breach or incident. Tothe extent these measures result in decreased productivity, harm our company culture, adversely affect our ability to timely and accurately report our financialstatements or maintain internal controls, or otherwise negatively affect our business, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\u2022We design and contract to manufacture Light Vehicles using a limited number of external suppliers, and a continuous, stable and cost-effective supply of LightVehicles that meet our standards is critical to our operations.

Further, COVID-19 has and may continue to negatively impact Lyft\u2019s ability to conduct rental operationsthrough the Express Drive program and Lyft Rentals as a result of restrictions on travel, mandated closures, limited staffing availability, and other factors relatedto COVID-19. For example, in 2020, Lyft Rentals temporarily ceased operations, closing its rental locations, as a result of COVID-19. Further, while ExpressDrive rental periods renew on a weekly basis, new rental reservations were temporarily blocked in 2020, and subsequently re-opened with modified operations tolimit the proximity and amount of interactions between associates and drivers, and to address additional cleaning which may be required as a result of COVID-19.These operations are more costly, and vulnerable to shortages of cleaning supplies or other materials required to operate rental sites while minimizing the risk ofexposure to COVID-19. As a result of the adverse impact to demand for rides on the rideshare platform, drivers renting through the Express Drive program havehad and may continue to have a diminished ability to pay their rental fees. In response, in 2020, Flexdrive temporarily reduced pricing for Flexdrive rentals incities most affected by COVID-19, which has since been reversed. In 2020, Flexdrive also began to waive rental fees for drivers who are confirmed to have testedpositive for COVID-19 or requested to quarantine by a medical professional, which it continues to do at this time.

In addition to the above, a determination in, or settlement of, anylegal proceeding that classifies a driver on a ridesharing platform as an employee may require us to significantly alter our existing business model and operations (includingpotentially suspending or ceasing operations in impacted jurisdictions), increase our costs and impact our ability to add qualified drivers to our platform and grow ourbusiness, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and our ability to achieve or maintain profitability in the future.Additionally,  stock-based  compensation  expense  related  to  restricted  stock  units  (\u201cRSUs\u201d)  and  other  equity  awards  may  continue  to  be  a  significant  expense  in  futureperiods, and as of December 31, 2021, we had $587.5 million of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to RSUs, net of estimated forfeitures, that will berecognized  over  a  weighted-average  period  of  approximately  1.7  years.  Any  failure  to  increase  our  revenue  sufficiently  to  keep  pace  with  our  investments  and  otherexpenses could prevent us from achieving or maintaining profitability or positive cash flow on a consistent basis. If we are unable to successfully address these risks andchallenges as we encounter them, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.As our business recovers from the effects of COVID-19 and we endeavor to return to pre-COVID financial performance, our revenue growth rates and results ofoperations will fluctuate due to a number of reasons, which may include long-term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, slowing demand for our offerings,increasing competition, a decrease in the growth of our overall market or market saturation, increasing regulatory costs and challenges and resulting changes to our businessmodel and our failure to capitalize on growth opportunities. If we are unable to generate adequate revenue growth and manage our expenses, we may continue to incursignificant losses in the future and may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability.We face intense competition and could lose market share to our competitors, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.The market for TaaS networks is intensely competitive and characterized by rapid changes in technology, shifting rider needs and frequent introductions of newservices and offerings.

Because our results of operations may vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, theresults of any one period should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. We have presented many of the factors that may cause our results of operationsto fluctuate in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section. Fluctuations in our results of operations may cause such results to fall below our financial guidance or other projections, or theexpectations of analysts or investors, which could cause the trading price of our Class A common stock to decline.The ridesharing market and the market for our other offerings, such as our network of Light Vehicles, are still in relatively early stages of growth and development andif such markets do not continue to grow, grow more slowly than we expect or fail to grow as large or otherwise develop as we expect, our business, financial conditionand results of operations could be adversely affected.Prior to COVID-19, the ridesharing market grew rapidly, but it is still relatively new, and it is uncertain to what extent market acceptance will continue to grow,particularly after the COVID-19 pandemic, if at all. In addition, the market for our other offerings, such as our network of Light Vehicles, is new and unproven, and it isuncertain whether demand for bike and scooter sharing will continue to grow and achieve wide market acceptance. Our success will depend to a substantial extent on thewillingness of people to widely adopt ridesharing and our other offerings. We cannot be certain whether the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to negatively impact thewillingness of drivers or riders to participate in ridesharing or the willingness of riders to use shared bikes or scooters. In addition, we paused our shared rides offerings(though we relaunched our shared rides offerings in select markets beginning in July 2021), and we were temporarily restricted from operating our bike share and scootershare programs in one jurisdiction due to public health and safety measures implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequently temporarily suspendedrentals of scooters due to concerns with certain aspects of the program. Although the scooter rental suspension was lifted in February 2021, in the event of a resurgence ofCOVID-19, we may be required or believe it is advisable to suspend such offerings again.

Additionally, from time to time we may re-evaluatethe markets in which we operate and the performance of our network of Light Vehicles, and we have discontinued and may in the future discontinue operations in certainmarkets as a result of such evaluations. Any of the foregoing risks and challenges could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.If we fail to cost-effectively attract and retain qualified drivers, or to increase utilization of our platform by existing drivers, our business, financial condition andresults of operations could be harmed.Our continued growth depends in part on our ability to cost-effectively attract and retain qualified drivers who satisfy our screening criteria and procedures and toincrease  utilization  of  our  platform  by  existing  drivers.  To  attract  and  retain  qualified  drivers,  we  have,  among  other  things,  offered  sign-up  and  referral  bonuses  andprovided access to third-party vehicle rental programs for drivers who do not have or do not wish to use their own vehicle. If we do not continue to provide drivers withflexibility on our platform, compelling opportunities to earn income and other incentive programs, such as volume-based discounts and performance-based bonuses, that arecomparable or superior to those of our competitors and other companies in the app-based work industry, or if drivers become dissatisfied with our programs and benefits orour requirements for drivers, including requirements regarding the vehicles they drive, we may fail to attract new drivers, retain current drivers or increase their utilizationof our platform, or we may experience complaints, negative publicity, strikes or other work stoppages that could adversely affect our users and our business. For example,during the pandemic, we have periodically had a shortage of available drivers relative to rider demand in certain markets particularly where restrictions on social activitiesand visiting business venues were or have been eased. This imbalance fluctuates for various reasons, and to the extent that driver availability remains limited and we offerincreased incentives to improve supply, our revenue may be negatively impacted. Additionally, following the passage of Proposition 22 in California, drivers have beenable to access the earning opportunities described in the ballot measure. Our competitors may attempt to compete for drivers on the basis of these earning opportunities, ordrivers may determine that such earning opportunities are not sufficient. Further, other jurisdictions may adopt similar laws and regulations, which would likely increaseour  expenses.  Notwithstanding  the  passage  of  Proposition  22,  ongoing  litigation  seeking  to  reclassify  drivers  as  employees  is  pending  in  multiple  jurisdictions.  Thisincludes  a  lawsuit  seeking  to  overturn  Proposition  22  in  California,  where  a  lower-court  judge  issued  an  order  on  August  20,  2021  finding  that  Proposition  22  isunenforceable (which order is now on appeal with Proposition 22 remaining in effect during the appeal). If such litigation is successful in one or more jurisdictions, we maybe  required  to  classify  drivers  as  employees  rather  than  independent  contractors  in  those  jurisdictions.  If  this  occurs,  we  may  need  to  develop  and  implement  anemployment model that we have not historically used or to cease operations, whether temporarily or permanently, in affected jurisdictions. We may face specific risksrelating to our ability to onboard drivers as employees, our ability to partner with third-party organizations to source drivers and our ability to effectively utilize employeedrivers to meet rider demand.If  drivers  are  unsatisfied  with  our  partners,  including  our  third-party  vehicle  rental  partners,  our  ability  to  attract  and  retain  qualified  drivers  who  satisfy  ourscreening criteria and procedures and to increase utilization of our platform by existing drivers could be adversely affected.

If our insurance or reinsurance coverage is insufficient for the needs of our business or our insurance providers are unable to meet theirobligations, we may not be able to mitigate the risks facing our business, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.From the time a driver becomes available to accept rides in the Lyft Driver App until the driver logs off and is no longer available to accept rides, we, through ourwholly-owned  insurance  subsidiary  and  deductibles,  often  bear  substantial  financial  risk  with  respect  to  auto-related  incidents,  including  auto  liability,  uninsured  andunderinsured motorist, auto physical damage, first party injury coverages including personal injury protection under state law and general business liabilities up to certainlimits. To comply with certain United States and Canadian province insurance regulatory requirements for auto-related risks, we procure a number of third-party insurancepolicies which provide the required coverage in such jurisdictions. In all U.S. states, our insurance subsidiary reinsures a portion, which may change from time to time, ofthe auto-related risk from some third-party insurance providers. In connection with our reinsurance and deductible arrangements, we deposit funds into trust accounts with athird-party financial institution from which some third-party insurance providers are reimbursed for claims payments. Our restricted reinsurance trust investments as ofDecember 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 were $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively. If we fail to comply with state insurance regulatory requirements or otherregulations  governing  insurance  coverage,  our  business,  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations  could  be  adversely  affected.  If  any  of  our  third-party  insuranceproviders or administrators who handle the claim on behalf of the third-party insurance providers become insolvent, they could be unable to pay any operations-relatedclaims that we make.We also procure third-party insurance policies to cover various operations-related risks including employment practices liability, workers\u2019 compensation, businessinterruptions,  cybersecurity  and  data  breaches,  crime,  directors\u2019  and  officers\u2019  liability  and  general  business  liabilities,  including  product  liability.  For  certain  types  ofoperations-related risks or future risks related to our new and evolving offerings, such as a scaled network of autonomous vehicles, we may not be able to, or may choosenot to, acquire insurance. In addition, we may not obtain enough insurance to adequately mitigate such operations-related risks or risks related to our new and evolvingofferings, and we may have to pay high premiums, self-insured retentions or deductibles for the coverage we do obtain. Additionally, if any of our insurance or reinsuranceproviders becomes insolvent, it could be unable to pay any operations-related claims that we make.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4660, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "426c5b0c-9dc7-47de-9e8f-d3d194334514": {"__data__": {"id_": "426c5b0c-9dc7-47de-9e8f-d3d194334514", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "23", "file_name": "lyft_2021.pdf", "file_path": "/media/mtl/Volume F/PROJECTS/projects/Func_Call/pdf/lyft_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1440303, "creation_date": "2025-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1cd9ac08-6d82-4437-8ca1-0af344e434d7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "23", "file_name": "lyft_2021.pdf", "file_path": "/media/mtl/Volume F/PROJECTS/projects/Func_Call/pdf/lyft_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1440303, "creation_date": "2025-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-28"}, "hash": "987da370bba7e777dcb8417c434193a0ba27139f530598b1cdfc98fb673118e8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "1a6f74e6-7b9f-41fc-84cf-ebd403441bf5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "23", "file_name": "lyft_2021.pdf", "file_path": "/media/mtl/Volume F/PROJECTS/projects/Func_Call/pdf/lyft_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1440303, "creation_date": "2025-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-28"}, "hash": "263549b31a01013e7aa8a5e853d23b7b1b609068108268d3c61c4fa624b22d9e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "For  certain  types  ofoperations-related risks or future risks related to our new and evolving offerings, such as a scaled network of autonomous vehicles, we may not be able to, or may choosenot to, acquire insurance.

Such factors can impact the reserves for claims incurred but not yet paid as well as the actuarial assumptions used to estimate thereserves for claims incurred but not yet reported and any related estimable expenses for current and historical periods. Additionally, we have encountered in the past, andmay encounter in the future, instances of insurance fraud, which could increase our actual insurance-related costs. For any of the foregoing reasons, our actual losses forclaims and related expenses may deviate, individually or in the aggregate, from the insurance reserves reflected in our consolidated financial statements. If we determinethat our estimated insurance reserves are inadequate, we may be required to increase such reserves at the time of the determination, which could result in an increase to ournet loss in the period in which the shortfall is determined and negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. For example, the adverse development toinsurance reserves we experienced in the fourth quarter of 2021 was largely attributable to historical auto losses that are associated with accident liabilities between 2018and 2020.We rely on a limited number of third-party insurance service providers for our auto-related insurance claims, and if such providers fail to service insurance claims toour expectations or we do not maintain business relationships with them, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.We rely on a limited number of third-party insurance service providers to service our auto-related claims.

If we cannot find alternatethird-party insurance service providers on terms acceptable to us, we may incur additional expenses related to servicing such auto-related claims using internal resources.We may, from time to time, explore the possibility of selling portions of retained insurance risk to third-parties. This may cause us to incur additional expenses inthe  total  cost  of  this  risk.  For  example,  in  the  first  quarter  of  fiscal  2020,  we  entered  into  a  Novation  Agreement  to  transfer  nearly  all  of  our  primary  auto  insuranceliabilities  related  to  periods  preceding  October  2018  to  a  third-party,  in  October  2020,  we  expanded  our  rideshare  insurance  program  to  include  additional  third-partyinsurance-service  providers,  and  in  April  2021,  we  executed  an  agreement  to  reinsure  our  captive  insurance  entity  for  $183  million  of  coverage  above  the  insuranceliabilities recorded as of March 31, 2021 for policies underwritten during the period of October 1, 2018 to October 1, 2020.

Any of the  foregoing  risks  couldadversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Changes to our pricing could adversely affect our ability to attract or retain qualified drivers and riders.Demand for our offerings is highly sensitive to the price of rides, the rates for time and distance driven, incentives paid to drivers and the fees we charge drivers.Many factors, including operating costs, legal and regulatory requirements or constraints and our current and future competitors\u2019 pricing and marketing strategies includingincreased incentives for drivers, could significantly affect our pricing strategies. Certain of our competitors offer, or may in the future offer, lower-priced or a broader rangeof offerings. Similarly, certain competitors may use marketing strategies that enable them to attract or retain qualified drivers and riders at a lower cost than we do. Thisincludes the use of pricing algorithms to set dynamic prices depending on the route, time of day and pick-up and drop-off locations of riders. From time to time, we havemade pricing changes and spent significant amounts on marketing and both rider and driver incentives, and we expect that, from time to time, we will be required, throughcompetition, regulation or otherwise, to reduce the price of rides for riders, increase the incentives we pay to drivers on our platform or reduce the fees we charge thedrivers on our platform, or to increase our marketing and other expenses to attract and retain qualified drivers and riders in response to competitive pressures. Furthermore,the economic sensitivity of drivers and riders on our platform may vary by geographic location, and as we expand, our pricing methodologies may not enable us to competeeffectively in these locations. Local regulations may affect our pricing in certain geographic locations, which could amplify these effects. For example, state and local lawsand  regulations  regarding  pricing  related  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic  and  otherwise  have  imposed  limits  on  prices  for  certain  services  and  certain  local  regulationsregarding minimum earnings standards for drivers have caused us to revise our pricing methodology in certain markets, including New York City and Seattle.

A determination in, or settlement of, any legal proceeding, whether we are party to such legal proceeding or not, that classifies a driver utilizing a ridesharingplatform  as  an  employee,  may  require  us  to  revise  our  pricing  methodologies  to  account  for  such  a  change  to  driver  classification.  The  passage  of  Proposition  22  inCalifornia has enabled us to provide additional earning opportunities to drivers in California, including guaranteed earnings. The transition has, and will continue to, requireadditional costs and we expect to face other challenges as we transition drivers to this new model, including changes to our pricing. We have also tested or launched, andmay in the future test or launch, certain changes to the rates and fee structure for drivers on our platform, which may not ultimately be successful in attracting and retainingqualified  drivers.  Moreover,  successful  litigation  to  overturn  Proposition  22, or  the  reclassification  of  drivers  on  our platform  as employees  could  reduce  the  availablesupply of drivers as drivers leave the platform due to the changes in flexibility under an employment model. While we do and will attempt to optimize ride prices andbalance supply and demand in our ridesharing marketplace, our assessments may not be accurate or there may be errors in the technology used in our pricing and we couldbe underpricing or overpricing our offerings. In addition, if the offerings on our platform change, then we may need to revise our pricing methodologies. As we continue tolaunch  new  and  develop  existing  asset-intensive  offerings  such  as  our  network  of  Light  Vehicles,  Driver  Hubs,  Driver  Centers  and  Mobile  Services,  Lyft  Auto  Care,Express Drive program and Lyft Rentals, factors such as maintenance, debt service, depreciation, asset life, supply chain efficiency and asset replacement may affect ourpricing methodologies. In addition, we have established environmental programs, such as our commitment to 100% EVs on our platform by the end of 2030, that may alsoaffect our pricing.

For example, in 2021, in New York City, a competing operator named Joco attempted to launch a bike share program in violation of Citi Bike\u2019s exclusivity,arguing that New York City could not regulate Joco because Joco\u2019s stations were in private garages. The City successfully obtained a preliminary injunction against Joco,with our support. However, Joco continues to operate in a limited manner and it is possible Lyft may need to further support the City in additional legal action against Joco.A negative  determination  in other legal  disputes regarding  bike and scooter  sharing, including  an adverse  determination  regarding  our existing  rights to operate,  couldadversely affect our competitive position and results of operations. Additionally, we may from time to time be denied permits to operate, or be temporarily restricted fromoperating due to public health and safety measures, our bike share program or scooter share program in certain jurisdictions. For example, the City of Miami suspendedrentals  of  bikes  and  scooters  from  March  through  October  2020  as  a  result  of  the  COVID-19 pandemic  and  again  suspended  rentals  of  scooters  from  December  2020through February 2021 and for a brief period in November 2021 due to concerns with certain aspects of the program. While we do not expect any denial or suspension in anindividual region to have a material impact, these denials or suspensions in the aggregate could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Even if we are ableto successfully develop and implement our network of Light Vehicles, there may be heightened public skepticism of this nascent service offering. In particular, there couldbe negative public perception surrounding bike and scooter sharing, including the overall safety and the potential for injuries occurring as a result of accidents involving anincreased number of bikes and scooters on the road, and the general safety of the bikes and scooters themselves. Such negative public perception may result from incidentson our platform or incidents involving our competitors\u2019 offerings.We design and contract to manufacture bikes and scooters using a limited number of external suppliers, and a continuous, stable and cost-effective supply of bikesand scooters that meets our standards is critical to our operations. We expect to continue to rely on external suppliers in the future. There can be no assurance we will beable to maintain our existing relationships with these suppliers and continue to be able to source our bikes and scooters on a stable basis, at a reasonable price or at all. Wealso  design  and  contract  to  manufacture  certain  assets  related  to  our  network  of  Light  Vehicles  and  we  rely  on  a  small  number  of  suppliers  for  components  andmanufacturing services.The supply chain for our bikes and scooters exposes us to multiple potential sources of delivery failure or shortages. In the event that our supply of bikes andscooters or key components is interrupted or there are significant increases in prices, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.Changes in business conditions, force majeure, any public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, governmental or regulatory changes and other factors beyond ourcontrol have affected and could continue to affect our suppliers\u2019 ability to deliver products and our ability to deploy products to the market on a timely basis.We incur significant costs related to the design, purchase, sourcing and operations of our network of Light Vehicles and we expect to continue incurring such costsas we expand our network of Light Vehicles. The prices and availability of bikes and scooters and related products may fluctuate depending on factors beyond our controlincluding market and economic conditions, tariffs, changes to import or export regulations and demand.

If any of our third-party vehicle rental partners or third-party vehicle supply, fleet management and finance partners terminates itsrelationship  with  us  or  refuses  to  renew  its  agreement  with  us  on  commercially  reasonable  terms,  the  availability  of  vehicles  for  drivers  in  certain  markets  could  beadversely impacted, and we may need to find an alternate  provider, and may not be able to secure similar terms or replace such partners in an acceptable  time frame.Similarly, in the event that vehicle manufacturers issue recalls that affect the usage or the supply of vehicles or automotive parts is interrupted, including as a result ofpublic  health  crises,  such  as  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  affecting  vehicles  in  these  partners\u2019  fleets,  the  supply  of  vehicles  available  from  these  partners  could  becomeconstrained. For example, in September 2019, GM issued a recall affecting the 2018 Chevy Malibu, which affected a moderate portion of the fleet provided by Lyft\u2019s rentalpartners. In addition, in May 2020, Hertz filed for bankruptcy protection, which affected their ability to meet the requirements of our Express Drive program. If we cannotfind alternate third-party vehicle rental providers on terms acceptable to us, or these partners\u2019 fleets are impacted by events such as vehicle recalls, we may not be able tomeet the driver and consumer demand for rental vehicles, and as a result, our platform may be less attractive to qualified drivers and consumers. In addition, due to anumber of factors, including our agreements with our vehicle rental partners and our auto-related insurance program, we incur an incrementally higher insurance cost fromour  Express  Drive  program  compared  to  the  corresponding  cost  from  the  rest  of  our  ridesharing  marketplace  offerings.

Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affectour business, financial condition and results of operations.Our Express Drive program, Lyft Rentals program, and potential future fleet businesses expose us to certain risks, including with respect to decreases in the residualvalue related to the used car market values, or reductions in the utilization of vehicles in the fleets.For  the  Lyft  Rentals  consumer  car  rental  business  and,  through  our  independently  managed  subsidiary,  Flexdrive,  for  vehicles  rented  to  drivers  through  ourExpress  Drive  program,  a  portion  of  the  fleet  is  sourced  from  a  range  of  auto  manufacturers.  In  addition,  we  have  established  environmental  programs,  such  as  ourcommitment to 100% EVs on our platform by the end of 2030, that may limit the range of auto manufacturers or vehicles that we source from or purchase. To the extentthat any of these auto manufacturers significantly curtail production, increase the cost of purchasing cars or decline to sell cars to us on terms or at prices consistent withpast agreements, despite sourcing vehicles from the used car market and other efforts to mitigate, we may be unable to obtain a sufficient number of vehicles to operate ourExpress Drive or Lyft Rentals businesses without significantly increasing fleet costs or reducing volumes. Similarly, where events, such as natural disasters or public healthcrises such as the COVID-19 pandemic, make operating rental locations difficult or impossible, or adversely impact rider demand, the demand for or our ability to rentvehicles in Lyft Rentals or the Express Drive program has been and could continue to be adversely affected, resulting in reduced utilization of the vehicles in the fleets.Reduced utilization has increased and could continue to increase costs of maintaining the fleets or storing or moving unused vehicles.The costs of the fleet vehicles may also be adversely impacted by the relative strength of the used car market. We currently sell vehicles through auctions, third-party resellers and other channels in the used vehicle marketplace. Such channels may not produce stable used vehicle prices. It may be difficult to estimate the residualvalue of vehicles used in ridesharing, such as those rented to drivers through our Express Drive program. Further, market events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, haveaffected the demand for or pricing in the used vehicle market. For example, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, operators of large fleets, such as rental companies, arereportedly  seeking  to  place  large  volumes  of  vehicles  into  the  resale  market,  which  have  driven  down  the  price  and  corresponding  residual  value  of  used  vehicles.  Areduction in residual values for vehicles in the Flexdrive or Lyft Rentals fleets could cause us to sustain a substantial loss on the ultimate sale of such vehicles or require usto depreciate those vehicles at a more accelerated rate.

Users on our platform depend on our support organization to resolve any issues relating to our offerings, such as being overcharged for a ride, leavingsomething in a driver\u2019s vehicle or reporting a safety incident. Our ability to provide effective and timely support is largely dependent on our ability to attract and retainservice  providers  who  are  qualified  to  support  users  and  sufficiently  knowledgeable  regarding  our  offerings.

Our  inability  to  adequately  detect  or  prevent  fraudulent  transactions  could  harm  our  reputation  or  brand,  result  in  litigation  orregulatory action and lead to expenses that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.We  have  also  incurred,  and  may  in  the  future  incur,  losses  from  fraud  and  other  misuse  of  our  platform  by  drivers  and  riders,  including  in  connection  withprograms we put in place in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, we have experienced reduced revenue from actual and alleged unauthorized rides fulfilledand miles traveled in connection with our Concierge offering. If we are unable to adequately anticipate and address such misuse either through increased controls, platformsolutions or other means, our partner relationships, business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.If we fail to effectively match riders on our Shared and Shared Saver Rides offering and manage the related pricing methodologies, our business, financial conditionand results of operations could be adversely affected.Shared and Shared Saver Rides enables unrelated parties traveling along similar routes to benefit from a discounted fare at the cost of possibly longer travel times.With  a  Shared  or  Shared  Saver  Ride,  when  the  first  rider  requests  a  ride,  our  algorithms  use  the  first  rider\u2019s  destination  and  attempt  to  match  them  with  other  riderstraveling along a similar route. If a match between riders is made, our algorithms re-route the driver to include the pick-up location of the matched rider on the active route.For Shared and Shared Saver Rides, drivers earn a fixed amount based on a number of factors, including the time and distance of the ride, the base fare charged to ridersand the level of rider demand. We determine the rider fare based on the predicted time and distance of the ride, the level of rider demand and the likelihood of being able tomatch additional riders along the given route, and such fare is quoted to the riders prior to their commitment to the ride. The fare charged to the riders is decoupled from thepayment made to the driver as we do not adjust the driver payment based on the success or failure of a match. Accordingly, if the discounted fare quoted and charged to ourShared or Shared Saver Rides riders is less than the fixed amount that drivers earn or if our algorithms are unable to consistently match Shared or Shared Saver Ridesriders, then our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.If we fail to effectively manage our up-front pricing methodology, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.With the adoption of our up-front pricing methodology, we quote a price to riders of our ridesharing offering before they request a ride. We earn platform andservice fees from drivers either as the difference between an amount paid by a rider, which is generally based on an up-front quoted fare, and the amount earned by a driverbased on the actual time and distance for the trip or as a fixed percentage of the fare charged to the rider, in each case, less any applicable driver bonuses or incentives andany pass-through amounts paid to drivers and third parties. As we do not control the driver\u2019s actions at any point in the transaction to limit the time and distance for the trip,we take on risks related to the driver\u2019s actions which may not be fully mitigated. We may incur a loss from a transaction where an up-front quoted fare paid by a rider isless  than  the  amount  we  committed  to  pay  a  driver.  In  addition,  riders\u2019  price  sensitivity  varies  by  geographic  location,  among  other  factors,  and  if  we  are  unable  toeffectively  account  for  such  variability  in  our  up-front  prices,  our  ability  to  compete  effectively  in  these  locations  could  be  adversely  affected.

If we are unable to attract and retain the necessary personnel, particularly incritical areas of our business, we may not achieve our strategic goals.We face intense competition for highly skilled personnel, especially in the San Francisco Bay Area where we have a substantial presence and need for highlyskilled personnel. This competition has intensified in recent periods, and may continue to intensify as the economy recovers from COVID-19. To attract and retain toptalent, we have had to offer, and we believe we will need to continue to offer, competitive compensation and benefits packages. Job candidates and existing personnel oftenconsider the value of the equity awards they receive in connection with their employment. If the perceived value of our equity awards declines or we are unable to providecompetitive compensation packages, it may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel, and we may experience increased attrition.

Use  and  distribution  of  open  sourcesoftware may entail greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide support, warranties, indemnification orother contractual protections regarding infringement claims or the quality of the code.

As a result, their application in practice may change or develop over time through judicial decisions or as new guidance or interpretations  are provided byregulatory and governing bodies, such as federal, state and local administrative agencies.The ridesharing industry and our business model are relatively nascent and rapidly evolving. When we introduced a peer-to-peer ridesharing marketplace in 2012,the laws and regulations in place at the time did not directly address our offerings. Laws and regulations that were in existence at that time, and some that have since beenadopted, were often applied to our industry and our business in a manner that limited our relationships with drivers or otherwise inhibited the growth of our ridesharingmarketplace.

These activities may not be successful, and any negative outcomes could adversely affect our business, operations, financial conditionand results of operations.Our industry is relatively nascent and is rapidly evolving and increasingly regulated. We have been subject to intense regulatory pressure from state and municipalregulatory authorities across the United States and Canada, and a number of them have imposed limitations on or attempted to ban ridesharing and bike and scooter sharing.For example, in December 2018, the New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission adopted rules governing minimum driver earnings calculations and utilization ratesapplicable to our ridesharing platform, as well as certain other ridesharing platforms. Our legal challenge was unsuccessful and other cities are exploring similar legislation.The  City  of  Seattle  adopted  the  Transportation  Network  Company  Driver  Minimum  Compensation  Ordinance  effective  January  1,  2021,  which  sets  minimum  driverearnings calculations for our rideshare platform as well as other rideshare platforms. The City of Portland is also exploring driver earnings legislation. Other jurisdictions inwhich we currently operate or may want to operate could follow suit. We could also face similar regulatory restrictions from foreign regulators as we expand operationsinternationally, particularly in areas where we face competition from local incumbents. Adverse changes in laws or regulations at all levels of government or bans on ormaterial limitations to our offerings could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our success, or perceived success, and increased visibility has driven, and may continue to drive, some businesses that perceive our business model negatively toraise their concerns to local policymakers and regulators. These businesses and their trade association groups or other organizations have and may continue to take actionsand employ significant resources to shape the legal and regulatory regimes in jurisdictions where we may have, or seek to have, a market presence in an effort to changesuch legal and regulatory regimes in ways intended to adversely affect or impede our business and the ability of drivers and riders to utilize our platform.Any of the foregoing risks could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.Challenges to contractor classification of drivers that use our platform may have adverse business, financial, tax, legal and other consequences to our business.We are regularly subject to claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, administrative actions, government investigations and other legal and regulatory proceedingsat the federal, state and municipal levels challenging the classification of drivers on our platform as independent contractors. The tests governing whether a driver is anindependent contractor or an employee vary by governing law and are typically highly fact sensitive. Laws and regulations that govern the status and misclassification ofindependent  contractors  are  subject  to  changes  and  divergent  interpretations  by  various  authorities  which  can  create  uncertainty  and  unpredictability  for  us.

We  are  currently  involved  in  several  putative  class  actions,  severalrepresentative  actions  brought,  for  example,  pursuant  to  California\u2019s  Private  Attorney  General  Act,  several  multi-plaintiff  actions  and  thousands  of  individual  claims,including those brought in arbitration or compelled pursuant to our Terms of Service to arbitration, challenging the classification of drivers on our platform as independentcontractors. We are also involved in administrative audits related to driver classification in California, Oregon, Wisconsin, Illinois, New York, and New Jersey. See thesection titled \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d for additional information about these types of legal proceedings.Claims by others that we infringed their proprietary technology or other intellectual property rights could harm our business.Companies in the markets in which we operate are frequently subject to litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual propertyrights. In addition, certain companies and rights holders seek to enforce and monetize patents or other intellectual property rights they own, have purchased or otherwiseobtained.  As  we  gain  an  increasingly  high  public  profile  and  the  number  of  competitors  in  our  market  increases  and  as  we  continue  to  develop  new  technologies  andintellectual property, the possibility of intellectual property rights claims against us grows based on the following: increase in public profile, increases in the number ofcompetitors in our markets, our continued development of new technologies, new products and services, and new IP, as well as potential international expansion. From timeto time third parties may assert, and in the past have asserted, claims of infringement of intellectual property rights against us. See the section titled \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d foradditional information about these types of legal proceedings. In addition, third parties have sent us correspondence regarding various allegations of intellectual propertyinfringement and, in some instances, have initiated licensing discussions. Although we believe that we have meritorious defenses, there can be no assurance that we will besuccessful in defending against these allegations or reaching a business resolution that is satisfactory to us. Our competitors and others may now and in the future havesignificantly larger and more mature patent portfolios than us. In addition, we have faced, and may again in the future face, litigation involving patent holding companies orother adverse patent owners who have no relevant product or service revenue and against whom our own patents may therefore provide little or no deterrence or protection.Many  potential  litigants,  including  some  of  our  competitors  and  patent-holding  companies,  have  the  ability  to  dedicate  substantial  resources  to  assert  their  intellectualproperty rights. Any claim of infringement by a third party, even those without merit, could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim, could distractour management from our business and could require us to cease use of such intellectual property. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required inconnection with intellectual property litigation, we risk compromising our confidential information during this type of litigation. We may be required to pay substantialdamages, royalties or other fees in connection with a claimant securing a judgment against us, we may be subject to an injunction or other restrictions that prevent us fromusing or distributing our intellectual property, or we may agree to a settlement that prevents us from distributing our offerings or a portion thereof, which could adverselyaffect our business, financial condition and results of operations.With respect to any intellectual property rights claim, we may have to seek out a license to continue operations found to be in violation of such rights, which maynot be available on favorable or commercially reasonable terms and may significantly increase our operating expenses.

Any of these events could adversely affect our business, financialcondition and results of operations.Failure to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our success is dependent in part upon protecting our intellectual property rights and technology (such as code, information, data, processes and other forms ofinformation, knowhow and technology), or intellectual property, and as we grow, we will continue to develop intellectual property that is important for our existing orfuture  business. We  rely  on a combination  of patents,  copyrights,  trademarks,  service  marks,  trade  dress, trade  secret  laws and contractual  restrictions  to establish  andprotect our intellectual property. However, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may not be sufficient or effective, and may vary by jurisdiction. Even if wedo detect violations, we may need to engage in litigation to enforce our rights.

These laws, rules and regulations evolve frequently and their scope may continuallychange, through new legislation, amendments to existing legislation and changes in enforcement, and may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another. For example, theCPRA will require new disclosures to California consumers and affords such consumers new data rights and abilities to opt-out of certain sharing of personal information.The CPRA provides for fines of up to $7,500 per violation, which can be applied on a per-consumer basis. Aspects of the CPRA and its interpretation and enforcementremain unclear. The effects of this legislation potentially are far-reaching, however, and may require us to further modify our data processing practices and policies andincur additional compliance-related costs and expenses. Additionally, other states have considered or have enacted legislation similar to the CCPA and CPRA.

For example, effective May 2018, we ended mandatory arbitration of sexual misconduct claims by users and employees.Further, with the potential for conflicting rules regarding the scope and enforceability of arbitration on a state-by-state basis, as well as between state and federallaw, there is a risk that some or all of our arbitration provisions could be subject to challenge or may need to be revised to exempt certain categories of protection. If ourarbitration agreements were found to be unenforceable, in whole or in part, or specific claims are required to be exempted from arbitration, we could experience an increasein our costs to litigate disputes and the time involved in resolving such disputes, and we could face increased exposure to potentially costly lawsuits, each of which couldadversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.As we expand our platform offerings, we may become subject to additional laws and regulations, and any actual or perceived failure by us to comply with such lawsand  regulations  or  manage  the  increased  costs  associated  with  such  laws  and  regulations  could  adversely  affect  our  business,  financial  condition  and  results  ofoperations.As we continue to expand our platform offerings and user base, we may become subject to additional laws and regulations, which may differ or conflict from onejurisdiction to another. Many of these laws and regulations were adopted prior to the advent of our industry and related technologies and, as a result, do not contemplate oraddress the unique issues faced by our industry.For example, contracting with healthcare entities and transportation brokers representing healthcare entities may subject us to certain healthcare related laws andregulations. These laws and regulations may impose additional requirements on us and our platform in providing access to rides through the Lyft Platform on behalf ofhealthcare partners.

New legislation may require us or drivers to incur substantial costs in order to comply, including costs associated with tax calculation, collection andremittance and audit requirements, which could make our offerings less attractive and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.As a result of these and other factors, the ultimate amount of tax obligations owed may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and any suchdifference may adversely impact our results of operations in future periods in which we change our estimates of our tax obligations or in which the ultimate tax outcome isdetermined.Operating as a public company requires us to incur substantial costs and requires substantial management attention.

Furthermore, these EV programs are asset-intensive and require significant capital investments and recurring costs, including debt payments, maintenance,depreciation, asset life and asset replacement costs, and if we are not able to maintain sufficient levels of utilization of such assets or such offerings are otherwise notsuccessful, our investments may not generate sufficient returns and our financial condition may be adversely affected. We may also enter into arrangements with thirdparties for financing, leasing or otherwise, to enable us to meet our commitment to 100% EVs on our platform by the end of 2030. Such transactions may require us toprovide guarantees for financing. We may also benefit from certain tax credits for EVs and, if such tax credits expire or are terminated or we are otherwise unable to usethem, we may not realize the benefits we have planned and our business and financial condition and results of operations may be negatively affected.Risks Related to Financing and Transactional FactorsWe may require additional capital, which may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all.Historically, we funded our capital-intensive operations and capital expenditures primarily through equity issuances and cash generated from our operations.

Our Co-Founders together hold all of the issued andoutstanding  shares  of  our  Class  B  common  stock.  Accordingly,  Logan  Green,  our  co-founder,  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  a  member  of  our  board  of  directors  holdsapproximately 21.42% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock; and John Zimmer, our co-founder and President and Vice Chair of our board of directors, holdsapproximately 12.63% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. Therefore, our Co-Founders, individually or together, will be able to significantly influencematters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors, amendments of our organizational documents and any merger, consolidation, sale ofall or substantially all of our assets or other major corporate transactions. Our Co-Founders, individually or together, may have interests that differ from yours and may votein a way with which you disagree and which may be adverse to your interests. This concentrated control may have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a changein  control  of  our  company,  could  deprive  our  stockholders  of  an  opportunity  to  receive  a  premium  for  their  capital  stock  as  part  of  a  sale  of  our  company  and  mightultimately affect the market price of our Class A common stock. Each Co-Founder\u2019s voting power is as of December 31, 2021 and includes shares of Class A commonstock expected to be issued upon the vesting of such Co-Founder\u2019s RSUs within 60 days of December 31, 2021.Future transfers by the holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting into shares of Class A common stock, subject to limitedexceptions, such as certain transfers effected for estate planning purposes. In addition, each share of Class B common stock will convert automatically into one share ofClass A common stock upon (i) the date specified by affirmative written election of the holders of two-thirds of the then-outstanding shares of Class B common stock, (ii)the date fixed by our board of directors that is no less than 61 days and no more than 180 days following the date on which the shares of Class B common stock held by ourCo-Founders and their permitted entities and permitted transferees represent less than 20% of the Class B common stock held by our Co-Founders and their permittedentities as of immediately following the completion of our initial public offering, or IPO, or (iii) nine months after the death or total disability of the last to die or becomedisabled of our Co-Founders, or such50", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 2944, "end_char_idx": 6818, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bf0e1b0c-a69e-4a87-b03d-3bce30c80c87": {"__data__": {"id_": "bf0e1b0c-a69e-4a87-b03d-3bce30c80c87", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "51", "file_name": "lyft_2021.pdf", "file_path": "/media/mtl/Volume F/PROJECTS/projects/Func_Call/pdf/lyft_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1440303, "creation_date": "2025-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "19eeb735-e302-4319-99a3-15b3cafa68af", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "51", "file_name": "lyft_2021.pdf", "file_path": "/media/mtl/Volume F/PROJECTS/projects/Func_Call/pdf/lyft_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1440303, "creation_date": "2025-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-28"}, "hash": "14e556486e19ad9df9090b25c701a5394edff22e63531d544c39249c64461c38", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "later date not to exc\need a total period of 18 months after such death or disability as may be approved by a majority of our independent directors.We cannot predict the impact our dual class structure may have on our stock price.We cannot predict whether our dual class structure will result in a lower or more volatile market price of our Class A common stock or in adverse publicity orother adverse consequences. For example, certain index providers have announced restrictions on including companies with multiple-class share structures in certain oftheir indexes. In July 2017, FTSE Russell and S&P Dow Jones announced that they would cease to allow most newly public companies utilizing dual or multi-class capitalstructures to be included in their indices. Affected indices include the Russell 2000 and the S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400 and S&P SmallCap 600, which together make upthe S&P Composite 1500. Beginning in 2017, MSCI, a leading stock index provider, opened public consultations on their treatment of no-vote and multi-class structuresand  temporarily  barred  new  multi-class  listings  from  certain  of  its  indices;  however,  in  October  2018,  MSCI  announced  its  decision  to  include  equity  securities  \u201cwithunequal voting structures\u201d in its indices and to launch a new index that specifically includes voting rights in its eligibility criteria. Under the announced policies, our dualclass capital structure makes us ineligible for inclusion in certain indices, and as a result, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds and other investment vehicles that attempt topassively  track  those indices  will not be investing  in our stock. These policies  are still  fairly  new and it is as of yet unclear  what effect,  if any, they will have on thevaluations of publicly traded companies excluded from the indices, but it is possible that they may depress these valuations compared to those of other similar companiesthat are included. Because of our dual class structure, we will likely be excluded from certain of these indexes and we cannot assure you that other stock indexes will nottake similar actions. Given the sustained flow of investment funds into passive strategies  that seek to track certain indexes, exclusion from stock indexes would likelypreclude investment by many of these funds and could make our Class A common stock less attractive to other investors. As a result, the market price of our Class Acommon stock could be adversely affected.The trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.The trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile and could be subject to fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond ourcontrol. These fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of your investment in our Class A common stock. Factors that could cause fluctuations in the trading price ofour Class A common stock include the following:\u2022price  and  volume  fluctuations  in  the  overall  stock  market  from  time  to  time,  including  fluctuations  due  to  general  economic  uncertainty  or  negative  marketsentiment, in particular related to the COVID-19 pandemic;\u2022volatility in the trading prices and trading volumes of technology stocks generally, or those in our industry, including fluctuations unrelated or disproportionate tothe operating performance of those technology companies;\u2022changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of other technology companies generally, or those in our industry in particular;\u2022sales or purchases of shares of our Class A common stock by us, our officers, or our significant stockholders, as well as the perception that such sales or purchasescould occur;\u2022failure of securities analysts to maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by securities analysts who follow our company or our failure to meet theseestimates or the expectations of investors;\u2022the financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in those projections or our failure to meet those projections;\u2022announcements by us or our competitors of new offerings or platform features;\u2022investor sentiment and the public\u2019s reaction to our press releases, other public announcements and filings with the SEC, or those of our competitors or others inour industry;\u2022rumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry;\u2022short selling of our Class A common stock or related derivative securities;\u2022actual or anticipated changes in our results of operations or fluctuations in our results of operations;\u2022actual or anticipated developments in our business, our competitors\u2019 businesses or the competitive landscape generally;\u2022litigation involving us, our industry or both, or investigations by regulators into our operations or those of our competitors;\u2022developments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights;\u2022announced or completed acquisitions of businesses, services or technologies by us or our competitors;51", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5045, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bb854f3f-379f-417c-a63b-fe4ecfd79ca0": {"__data__": {"id_": "bb854f3f-379f-417c-a63b-fe4ecfd79ca0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "52", "file_name": "lyft_2021.pdf", "file_path": "/media/mtl/Volume F/PROJECTS/projects/Func_Call/pdf/lyft_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1440303, "creation_date": "2025-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "81123d0a-7d3a-4ac4-949e-71061fae1898", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "52", "file_name": "lyft_2021.pdf", "file_path": "/media/mtl/Volume F/PROJECTS/projects/Func_Call/pdf/lyft_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1440303, "creation_date": "2025-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-28"}, "hash": "5033ce48be32fa1275ffb9c48f5929ef160f4facd16dda64443a861dea13107c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "\u2022\nnew laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business or statements by public officials regarding potential newlaws or regulations;\u2022changes in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations or principles;\u2022any significant change in our management or our board of directors; and\u2022general economic conditions and slow or negative growth of our markets.In  addition,  in  the  past,  following  periods  of  volatility  in  the  overall  market  and  the  market  price  of  a  particular  company\u2019s  securities,  securities  class  actionlitigation has often been instituted against these companies.

As a result, subject to the satisfaction ofapplicable exercise periods, the shares issued upon exercise of outstanding stock options or upon settlement of outstanding RSU awards will be available for immediateresale in the United States in the open market.Sales of our Class A common stock may make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate. Thesesales could also cause the trading price of our Class A common stock to fall and make it more difficult for you to sell shares of our Class A common stock.Delaware law and provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could make a merger, tender offer or proxycontest difficult, thereby depressing the market price of our Class A common stock.Our status as a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay or prevent a change incontrol by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which theperson became an interested stockholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders.

Since  the  pandemic  began  in  March  2020,governments  and  private  businesses  -  at  the  recommendation  of  public  health  officials  -  have  enacted  precautions  to  mitigate  the  spread  of  the  virus,  including  travelrestrictions  and  social  distancing  measures  in  many  regions  of  the  United  States  and  Canada,  and  many  enterprises  have  instituted  and  maintained  work  from  homeprograms and limited the number of employees on site. Beginning in the middle of March 2020, the pandemic and these related responses caused decreased demand for ourplatform leading to decreased revenues as well as decreased earning opportunities for drivers on our platform. Our business continues to be impacted by the COVID-19pandemic.Although we have seen some signs of demand improving as COVID-19 case counts trended down, particularly compared to the demand levels at the start of thepandemic, demand levels continue to be affected by the impact of variants and changes in case counts. The exact timing and pace of the recovery remain uncertain. Theextent  to  which  our  operations  will  continue  to  be  impacted  by  the  pandemic  will  depend  largely  on  future  developments,  which  are  highly  uncertain  and  cannot  beaccurately predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning COVID-19 variants and the severity of the pandemic and actions by government authoritiesand private businesses to contain the pandemic or recover from its impact, among other things. For example, an increase in cases due to variants of the virus has causedmany businesses to delay employees returning to the office. Even as travel restrictions and shelter-in-place orders are modified or lifted, we anticipate that continued socialdistancing, altered consumer behavior, reduced travel and commuting, and expected corporate cost cutting will be significant challenges for us.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4316, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dfa736f7-57be-4b93-a64a-bd5a40da0059": {"__data__": {"id_": "dfa736f7-57be-4b93-a64a-bd5a40da0059", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "56", "file_name": "lyft_2021.pdf", "file_path": "/media/mtl/Volume F/PROJECTS/projects/Func_Call/pdf/lyft_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1440303, "creation_date": "2025-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a02a775c-865d-4406-90b0-582f85030a80", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "56", "file_name": "lyft_2021.pdf", "file_path": "/media/mtl/Volume F/PROJECTS/projects/Func_Call/pdf/lyft_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1440303, "creation_date": "2025-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-28"}, "hash": "13b35ede98d9fc58dfa849e13005342a61ebd419814c028aa644c20871342f9a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "84186f1b-4e7b-4f99-9d79-f8181c4b1ee0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "56", "file_name": "lyft_2021.pdf", "file_path": "/media/mtl/Volume F/PROJECTS/projects/Func_Call/pdf/lyft_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1440303, "creation_date": "2025-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-28"}, "hash": "aba18ecaa34cd59931f638e4f2b207823d1e02946b9eb3ee7912d2ca753c8b92", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "The exact timing and pace of the recovery remain uncertain.

(\u201cWoven Planet\u201d)On July 13, 2021, we completed a multi-element transaction with Woven Planet, a subsidiary of Toyota Motor Corporation, for the divestiture of certain assetsrelated  to  our  self-driving  vehicle  division,  Level  5,  as  well  as  commercial  agreements  for  the  utilization  of  Lyft  rideshare  and  fleet  data  to  accelerate  the  safety  andcommercialization of the automated-driving vehicles that Woven Planet is developing. We will receive, in total, approximately $515 million in cash in connection with thistransaction, with $165 million paid upfront and $350 million to be paid over a five-year period.The divestiture  did not represent a strategic shift with a major effect on our operations and financial  results, and therefore does not qualify for reporting as adiscontinued operation. We recognized a pre-tax gain of $119.3 million as a result of our transaction with Woven Planet, which was included in other income, net on theconsolidated statement of operations for the quarter ended September 30, 2021.

Revenue per Active Riderrepresents our ability to drive usage and monetization of our platform.Active Riders 20212020 2019 2020 to 2021 % Change2019 to 2020 % Change(in thousands, except for dollar amounts and percentages)Three Months Ended March 3113,494 21,211 20,503 (36.4)% 3.5% Three Months Ended June 3017,142 8,688 21,807 97.3% (60.2)% Three Months Ended September 3018,942 12,513 22,314 51.4% (43.9)% Three Months Ended December 3118,728 12,552 22,905 49.2% (45.2)% 57", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3371, "end_char_idx": 4747, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3357f92e-7eef-4adf-877b-47c8eb2cc9fc": {"__data__": {"id_": "3357f92e-7eef-4adf-877b-47c8eb2cc9fc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "58", "file_name": "lyft_2021.pdf", "file_path": "/media/mtl/Volume F/PROJECTS/projects/Func_Call/pdf/lyft_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1440303, "creation_date": "2025-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5629f8db-8483-4d94-924c-28f64fd61df5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "58", "file_name": "lyft_2021.pdf", "file_path": "/media/mtl/Volume F/PROJECTS/projects/Func_Call/pdf/lyft_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1440303, "creation_date": "2025-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-28"}, "hash": "9d76755f5306233a6664d18e8c82260251ad24b225a61b5e7458c6d8bc08b6ac", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "6e9d22d2-b4c3-49fd-b5a8-bbb7a9b32883", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3963138efb1ea35b4c968f6c37d31e6b5bec09968057545b7b47aefa4a142eae", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Revenue per Active Rider\n20212020 2019 2020 to 2021 % Change2019 to 2020 % ChangeThree Months Ended March 31$45.13 $45.06 $37.86 0.2% 19.0% Three Months Ended June 30$44.63 $39.06 $39.77 14.3% (1.8)% Three Months Ended September 30$45.63 $39.94 $42.82 14.2% (6.7)% Three Months Ended December 31$51.79 $45.40 $44.40 14.1% 2.3% We define Active Riders as all riders who take at least one ride during a quarter where the Lyft Platform processes the transaction. An Active Rider is identified bya unique phone number. If a rider has two mobile phone numbers or changed their phone number and such rider took rides using both phone numbers during the quarter,that person would count as two Active Riders. If a rider has a personal and business profile tied to the same mobile phone number, that person would be considered a singleActive Rider. If a ride has been requested by an organization using our Concierge offering for the benefit of a rider, we exclude this rider in the calculation of Active Ridersunless the ride is accessible in the Lyft App. Revenue per Active Rider is calculated by dividing revenue for a period by Active Riders for the same period.Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020, some riders were able to access their Concierge rides in the Lyft App if they already had a Lyft account. Accordingly,Lyft updated the definition of Active Riders to include Concierge riders if the rider\u2019s phone number matches that of a verified Lyft account, allowing the rider to accesstheir ride in the Lyft App. This update resulted in a 0.01% increase, or an additional 927 Active Riders in the fourth quarter of 2020. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2020, allConcierge riders were excluded from the calculation of Active Riders as Concierge rides could not be matched with verified rider accounts.With the exception of the three months ended March 31, 2021 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020, Active Riders in each of the three monthperiods  ended  June  30,  September  30,  and  December  31,  2021  increased  compared  to  the  same  period  in  2020  as  vaccines  were  more  widely  distributed  and  morecommunities fully reopened. Active Riders in the three months periods ended June 30, September 30, and December 31, 2020 represented significantly lower Active Ridercounts since shelter-in-place orders and other travel restrictions were first implemented across North America in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. Theslight decrease in the number of Active Riders in the three months ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2021 was due primarilyto the increasing COVID-19 case counts from COVID-19 variants and their impact on demand as well as the seasonality we typically experience in the winter months.Revenue per Active Rider increased in each of the three months periods ended March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31, 2021 as compared to the sameperiods  in  2020,  primarily  reflecting  the  improvement  in  demand  on  our  platform  compared  to  earlier  periods  during  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  which  had  materiallylimited people's mobility and severely reduced Active Riders. Revenue per Active Rider reached an all-time high in the three months ended December 31, 2021, increasingcompared to the three months ended September 30, 2021. This was driven by an increase in ride frequency as well as a shift toward higher revenue rides such as airportrides, reflecting the increased travel experienced in the fourth quarter in 2021 nationwide.

This service includes on-demand lead generation that assists drivers tofind, receive and fulfill on-demand requests from riders seeking transportation services and related collection activities using our Lyft Platform. As a result, our singleperformance obligation in the transaction is to connect drivers with riders to facilitate the completion of a successful transportation service for riders.We evaluate the presentation of revenue on a gross versus net basis based on whether we act as a principal by controlling the transportation service provided to therider or whether we act as an agent by arranging for third parties to provide the service to the rider. We facilitate the provision of a transportation service by a driver to arider (the driver\u2019s customer) in order for the driver to fulfill their contractual promise to the rider. The driver fulfills their promise to provide a transportation service to theircustomer  through  use  of  the  Lyft  Platform.  While  we  facilitate  setting  the  price  for  transportation  services,  the  drivers  and  riders  have  the  discretion  in  accepting  thetransaction price through the platform. We do not control the transportation services being provided to the rider nor do we have inventory risk related to the transportationservices. As a result, we act as an agent in facilitating the ability for a driver to provide a transportation service to a rider.We report revenue on a net basis, reflecting the service fees and commissions owed to us from the drivers as revenue, and not the gross amount collected from therider. We made this determination of not being primarily responsible for the services since we do not promise the transportation services, do not contract with drivers toprovide transportation services on our behalf, do not control whether the driver accepts or declines the transportation request via the Lyft Platform, and do not control theprovision of transportation services by drivers to riders at any point in time either before, during, or after, the trip.We  consider  the  ToS and our customary  business  practices  in identifying  the contracts  under  ASC 606. As our customary  business  practice,  a contract  existsbetween the driver and us when the driver\u2019s ability to cancel the trip lapses, which typically is upon pickup of the rider. We collect the fare and related charges from riderson behalf of drivers using the rider\u2019s pre-authorized credit card or other payment mechanism and retain any fees owed to us before making the remaining disbursement todrivers; thus the driver\u2019s ability and intent to pay is not subject to significant judgment.We earn service fees and commissions from the drivers either as the difference between an amount paid by a rider based on an upfront quoted fare and the amountearned by a driver based on actual time and distance for the trip or as a fixed percentage of the fare charged to the rider. In an upfront quoted fare arrangement, as we do notcontrol the driver\u2019s actions at any point in the transaction to limit the time and distance for the trip, we take on risks related to the driver\u2019s actions which may not be fullymitigated. We earn a variable amount from the drivers and may record a loss from a transaction, which is recorded as a reduction to revenue, in instances where an up-frontquoted fare offered to a rider is less than the amount we are committed to pay the driver.We  recognize  revenue  upon  completion  of  a  ride  as  the  single  performance  obligation  is  satisfied  and  we  have  the  right  to  receive  payment  for  the  servicesrendered upon the completion of the ride.We offer various incentive programs to drivers that are recorded as reduction to revenue if we do not receive a distinct good or service in consideration or if wecannot reasonably estimate the fair value of goods or services received.In some cases, we also earn Concierge platform fees from organizations that use our Concierge offering, which is a product that allows organizations to requestrides for their customers and employees through our ridesharing marketplace. Concierge platform fees are earned as a fixed dollar amount per ride or a percentage of theride price depending on the contract and such Concierge platform fee revenue is recognized on a gross basis.We recognize revenue from subscription fees paid by users to access transportation options through the Lyft Platform and mobile-based applications over theapplicable subscription period.We generate revenue from licensing and data access agreements.

Revenue generated from Flexdriveand Lyft Rentals is recognized evenly over the rental period, which is typically seven days or less. Due to the short-term nature of the Flexdrive, Lyft Rentals, and LightVehicle transactions, we classify these rentals as operating leases.Insurance ReservesWe utilize both a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary and third-party insurance, which may include deductibles and self-insured retentions, to insure orreinsure costs including auto liability, uninsured and underinsured motorist, auto physical damage, first party injury coverages including personal injury protection understate law and general business liabilities up to certain limits. The recorded liabilities reflect the estimated cost for claims incurred but not paid and claims that have beenincurred but not yet reported and any estimable administrative run-out expenses related to the processing of these outstanding claim payments. Liabilities are determined ona quarterly basis by internal actuaries through an analysis of historical trends, changes in claims experience including consideration of new information and application ofloss development factors among other inputs and assumptions. On an annual basis, an independent third-party actuary will evaluate the liabilities for appropriateness withclaims reserve valuations.Insurance claims may take years to completely settle, and we have limited historical loss experience. Because of the limited operational history, we make certainassumptions  based  on  currently  available  information  and  industry  statistics,  with  the  loss  development  factors  as  one  of  the  most  significant  assumptions,  and  utilizeactuarial models and techniques to estimate the reserves. A number of factors can affect the actual cost of a claim, including the length of time the claim remains open,economic and healthcare cost trends and the results of related litigation. Furthermore, claims may emerge in future years for events that occurred in a prior year at a ratethat differs from previous actuarial projections. The impact of these factors on ultimate costs for insurance is difficult to estimate and could be material. However, while webelieve that the insurance reserve amount is adequate, the ultimate liability may be in excess of, or less than, the amount provided. As a result, the net amounts that willultimately be paid to settle the liability and when amounts will be paid may significantly vary from the estimated amounts provided for in the consolidated balance sheets.We continue to review our insurance reserve estimates in a regular, ongoing process as historical experience develops, additional claims are reported as settled, and thelegal, regulatory and economic environment evolves.Stock-Based CompensationWe incur stock-based compensation expense primarily from RSUs, performance based stock units (\u201cPSUs\u201d), stock options and stock purchase rights granted underour Employee Stock Purchase Plan (\u201cESPP\u201d).We  estimate  the fair  value  of stock options  granted  to employees,  directors  and consultants  and ESPP purchase  rights  using the  Black-Scholes  option-pricingmodel.  The  fair  value  of  stock  options  that  are  expected  to  vest  is  recognized  as  compensation  expense  on  a  straight-line  basis  over  the  requisite  service  period.  Werecognize compensation expense related to the ESPP purchase rights on a straight-line basis over the offering period, which is typically 12 months.The  fair  value  of  RSUs  and  PSUs  are  estimated  based  on  the  fair  market  value  of  our  common  stock  on  the  date  of  grant,  which  subsequent  to  our  IPO  isdetermined based on the closing price of our Class A common stock as reported on the date of grant. Prior to our IPO, we granted RSUs which vest upon the satisfaction ofboth a service condition and a performance condition.Compensation  expense  for  RSUs  with  service  and  performance  conditions  is  amortized  on  a  graded  basis  over  the  requisite  service  period  as  long  as  theperformance  condition  in  the  form  of  a  specified  liquidity  event  is  probable  to  occur.  The  liquidity  event  condition  was  satisfied  upon  the  effectiveness  of  our  IPORegistration Statement on March 28, 2019.

The excess of the fair value ofpurchase consideration over the values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. When determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilitiesassumed, we make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to bereasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. During the measurement period, not to exceedone year from the date of acquisition, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with a corresponding offset to goodwill if new informationis obtained related to facts and60", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3896, "end_char_idx": 6247, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0b3955a7-4ecc-4716-8ed3-c731380445fb": {"__data__": {"id_": "0b3955a7-4ecc-4716-8ed3-c731380445fb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "61", "file_name": "lyft_2021.pdf", "file_path": "/media/mtl/Volume F/PROJECTS/projects/Func_Call/pdf/lyft_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1440303, "creation_date": "2025-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "84b0c8cd-5669-4906-9afb-b8aab6457f57", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "61", "file_name": "lyft_2021.pdf", "file_path": "/media/mtl/Volume F/PROJECTS/projects/Func_Call/pdf/lyft_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1440303, "creation_date": "2025-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-28"}, "hash": "bcb7215b63ab0f6f95470e3c5429c06255a87a0ae23413941deddc619571dadf", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "circumstances\n that existed as of the acquisition date.

As part of the annual goodwill impairment test, we first perform a qualitative assessment to determinewhether further impairment testing is necessary. If, as a result of its qualitative assessment, it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than itscarrying amounts, the quantitative impairment test will be required.

Components of Results of OperationsAs noted above, we expect to see decreased levels of demand for our platform, decreased numbers of new rider activations, and negative impacts on revenue for solong  as  responsive  measures  to  COVID-19  remain  in  place  when  compared  to  levels  prior  to  the  onset  of  the  COVID-19 pandemic  in  March  2020.  We  have  adoptedmultiple measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We cannot be certain that these actions will mitigate some or all of the negative effects of the pandemic on ourbusiness. In light of the evolving and unpredictable effects of COVID-19, we are not currently in a position to forecast the expected impact of COVID-19 on our financialand operating results in future periods.Revenue RecognitionRevenue consists of revenue recognized from fees paid by drivers for use of our Lyft Platform offerings, Concierge platform fees from organizations that use ourConcierge offering, subscription fees paid by riders to access transportation options through the Lyft Platform, revenue from our vehicle service centers and revenue fromlicensing and data access agreements.

We  believeContribution and Contribution Margin are key measures of our ability to achieve profitability and increase it over time. Contribution Margin has generally increased overthe periods presented as revenue has increased at a faster rate than the costs included in the calculation of Contribution.We define Contribution as revenue less cost of revenue, adjusted to exclude the following items from cost of revenue:\u2022amortization of intangible assets;\u2022stock-based compensation expense;\u2022payroll tax expense related to stock-based compensation;\u2022changes to the liabilities for insurance required by regulatory agencies attributable to historical periods;\u2022transaction costs related to certain legacy auto insurance liabilities, if any; and\u2022restructuring charges, if any.For more information about cost of revenue, see the section titled \u201cComponents of Results of Operations\u2014Cost of Revenue.\u201dContribution Margin is calculated by dividing Contribution for a period by revenue for the same period.We  record  changes  to  historical  liabilities  for  insurance  required  by  regulatory  agencies  for  financial  reporting  purposes  in  the  quarter  of  positive  or  adversedevelopment even though such development may be related to claims that occurred in prior periods. For example, if in the first quarter of a given year, the cost of claimsgrew by $1 million for claims related to the prior fiscal year or earlier, the expense would be recorded for GAAP purposes within the first quarter instead of in the results ofthe prior period. We believe these prior period changes to insurance liabilities do not illustrate the current period performance of our ongoing operations since these priorperiod changes relate to claims that could potentially date back years. We have limited ability to influence the ultimate development of historical claims. Accordingly,including the prior period changes would not illustrate the performance of our ongoing operations or how the business is run or managed by us. For consistency, we do notadjust the calculation of Contribution for any prior period based on any positive or adverse development that occurs subsequent to the quarter end. Annual Contribution iscalculated by adding Contribution of the last four quarters. We believe the adjustment to exclude changes to the historical liabilities for insurance required by regulatoryagencies  from  Contribution  and  Adjusted  EBITDA  is  useful  to  investors  by  enabling  them  to  better  assess  our  operating  performance  in  the  context  of  current  periodresults.During the second quarter of 2021, we entered into a Quota Share Reinsurance Agreement for the reinsurance of legacy auto insurance liabilities between October1, 2018 to October 1, 2020, based on the reserves in place as of March 31, 2021.

When the amount and timing of the reinsurance recoveries are uncertain, the recovery method should be used. The deferred gainliability would be amortized and recognized as a benefit to the statement of operations over the estimated remaining settlement period of the ceded reserves. The settlementperiod of the ceded reserves will be based on the life-to-date  cumulative  losses collected  and will likely extend over periods longer than a quarter.  The amount of thedeferral  will  be  recalculated  each  period  based  on  loss  payments  and  updated  estimates.  Consequently,  cumulative  adverse  development  for  claims  ceded  under  theReinsurance Agreement in subsequent periods may result in significant losses to the statement of operations unless the deferred gain amortization recognized in the sameperiod to offset said losses. We believe that the net amount recognized on the statement of operations associated with claims ceded under the Reinsurance Agreement,including any related adverse development and any benefit recognized for the related deferred gains, should be excluded to show the ultimate economic benefit of theReinsurance Agreement. This adjustment will help investors understand the economic benefit of our Reinsurance Agreement on future trends in our operations, as theyimprove  over  the  settlement  period  of  any  deferred  gains.  Additionally,  net  amounts  recognized  for  claims  ceded  under  the  Reinsurance  Agreement  would  representchanges to historical liabilities for insurance required by regulatory agencies. As stated above, we believe prior period changes to insurance liabilities do not illustrate thecurrent period performance of our ongoing operations or how the business is managed. This is because we have limited ability to influence the ultimate development ofthese historical claims, which can potentially date back years. Therefore, in the event that the net amount of any adverse developments and any benefits from deferred gainsrelated to claims ceded under the Reinsurance Agreement is recognized on the statement of operations in a subsequent period, those amounts will be excluded from thecalculation of Contribution and Adjusted EBITDA through the exclusion of changes to liabilities for insurance required by regulatory agencies attributable to historicalperiods.

We have adopted several measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic including, but not limited to, establishing new health and safety requirements forridesharing, and updating workplace policies.

Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regardingthe amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made bymanagement, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtainingan  understanding  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  assessing  the  risk  that  a  material  weakness  exists,  and  testing  and  evaluating  the  design  and  operatingeffectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.

A company\u2019s internal control over financial reportingincludes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositionsof the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance withgenerally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management anddirectors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019sassets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because  of  its  inherent  limitations,  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  may  not  prevent  or  detect  misstatements.  Also,  projections  of  any  evaluation  ofeffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with thepolicies or procedures may deteriorate.75", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3324, "end_char_idx": 5572, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "65a8e880-ab01-4305-b1f2-f0f1a913309d": {"__data__": {"id_": "65a8e880-ab01-4305-b1f2-f0f1a913309d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "76", "file_name": "lyft_2021.pdf", "file_path": "/media/mtl/Volume F/PROJECTS/projects/Func_Call/pdf/lyft_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1440303, "creation_date": "2025-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "718190a9-5963-412a-9d60-02013ca9889a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "76", "file_name": "lyft_2021.pdf", "file_path": "/media/mtl/Volume F/PROJECTS/projects/Func_Call/pdf/lyft_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1440303, "creation_date": "2025-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-28"}, "hash": "22cd353a986b9705a17bad4513227d5b6323441477291274fb9efa1948b64f3f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c8da11f6-f78a-4b54-b718-9054701fd955", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e1fb02b3516d5e0a16c420df4eb64280339a2b475a117c64ab010a56304b1928", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Critical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicatedor  required  to  be  communicated  to  the  audit  committee  and  that  (i)  relate  to  accounts  or  disclosures  that  are  material  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements  and  (ii)involved  our  especially  challenging,  subjective,  or  complex  judgments.

As of December 31, 2021, insurancereserves totaled $1,069 million. Management makes certain assumptions based on currently available information and industry statistics, with the loss development factorsas one of the most significant assumptions and utilizes actuarial models and techniques to estimate the reserves. Liabilities are determined on a quarterly basis through ananalysis of historical trends, changes in claims experience including consideration of new information and application of loss development factors among other inputs andassumptions.The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of insurance reserves is a critical audit matter are (i) thesignificant judgment by management when developing the estimated insurance reserves, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort inperforming procedures relating to the valuation of insurance reserves; (ii) the significant auditor effort and judgment in evaluating audit evidence related to the actuarialvaluation methods and the loss development factors; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financialstatements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the valuation of insurance reserves, including the controls over the development ofthe actuarial valuation methods and the loss development factors. These procedures also included, among others, the involvement of professionals with specialized skill andknowledge  to  assist  in  developing  an  independent  estimate  of  the  insurance  reserves  for  certain  reserve  segments  and  comparison  of  this  independent  estimate  tomanagement\u2019s  actuarially  determined  reserves.

(\u201cWoven Planet\u201d)As described in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company completed a multi-element transaction with Woven Planet, a subsidiary of ToyotaMotor Corporation, for the divestiture of certain assets related to the Company\u2019s self-driving vehicle division, Level 5, as well as commercial agreements for the utilizationof Lyft rideshare and fleet data. The Company will receive, in total, approximately $515 million in cash in connection with this transaction, with $165 million paid upfrontand  $350  million  to  be  paid  over  a  five-year  period.

Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesUse of EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts ofassets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expensesduring the reporting periods. The Company bases its estimates on various factors and information which may include, but are not limited to, history and prior experience,expected future results, new related events and economic conditions, which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that arenot readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.85", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3300, "end_char_idx": 5597, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b0138b89-14c6-413e-b32e-df4ab9c811f2": {"__data__": {"id_": "b0138b89-14c6-413e-b32e-df4ab9c811f2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "86", "file_name": "lyft_2021.pdf", "file_path": "/media/mtl/Volume F/PROJECTS/projects/Func_Call/pdf/lyft_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1440303, "creation_date": "2025-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "bd74097e-28d0-493e-a2d6-ef9859aa48f7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "86", "file_name": "lyft_2021.pdf", "file_path": "/media/mtl/Volume F/PROJECTS/projects/Func_Call/pdf/lyft_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1440303, "creation_date": "2025-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-28"}, "hash": "1cd8a585d0769892e04488211de16283a0368bc03bbc2de9a8290ca443ea9a34", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Significant items\n subject to estimates and assumptions include those related to losses resulting from insurance claims, fair value of financial instruments, goodwilland  identifiable  intangible  assets,  leases,  indirect  tax  obligations,  legal  contingencies,  valuation  allowance  for  deferred  income  taxes,  and  the  valuation  of  stock-basedcompensation.Beginning in the middle of March 2020, the outbreak of the coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) in the United States, Canada, and globally has impacted the Company\u2019sbusiness.

The  Company  recognizes  revenue  upon  completion  of  each  ride.  Drivers  enter  into  terms  of  service  (\u201cToS\u201d)  with  theCompany in order to use the Lyft Driver App. Under the ToS, drivers agree that the Company retains the applicable fee as consideration for their use of the Lyft Platformand related activities from the fare and related charges it collects from riders on behalf of drivers. The Company is acting as an agent in facilitating the ability of a driver toprovide a transportation service to a rider. The Company reports revenue on a net basis, reflecting the fee owed to the Company from a driver as revenue, and not the grossamount collected from the rider.As the Company\u2019s customary business practice, a contract exists between the driver and the Company when the driver\u2019s ability to cancel the ride lapses, whichtypically is upon pickup of the rider. The Company\u2019s single performance obligation in the transaction is to connect drivers with riders to facilitate the completion of asuccessful transportation service for riders.

The Company collects the fare and related charges from riders on behalf of drivers using the rider\u2019s pre-authorized credit card or other payment mechanism andretains its fees before making the remaining disbursement to drivers; thus the driver\u2019s ability and intent to pay is not subject to significant judgment.The Company recognizes revenue from subscription fees paid to access transportation options through the Lyft Platform and mobile-based applications over theapplicable subscription period in accordance with ASC 606. The Company also recognizes revenue from auto maintenance and collision repair services in accordance withASC 606.The Company generates revenue from licensing and data access agreements. The Company is primarily responsible for fulfilling its promise to provide ridesharedata  and  access  to  Flexdrive  vehicles  and  bears  the  fulfillment  risk,  and  the  responsibility  of  providing  the  data,  over  the  license  period.  The  Company  is  acting  as  aprincipal in delivering the data and access licenses and presents revenue on a gross basis. Consideration allocated to each performance obligation, the data delivery andvehicle access, is determined by assigning the relative fair value to each of the performance obligations. Revenue is recorded upon delivery of the rideshare data and ratablyover the quarter for access to fleet vehicles as the Company\u2019s respective performance obligation is satisfied upon the delivery of each.Rental Revenue (ASC 842)The Company generates rental revenues primarily from Flexdrive, its network of Light Vehicles, and Lyft Rentals. Rental revenues are recognized for rental andrental related activities where an identified asset is transferred to the customer and the customer has the ability to control that asset in accordance with ASC 842.The Company operates a fleet of rental vehicles through Flexdrive comprised of both owned vehicles and vehicles leased from third-party leasing companies. TheCompany either leases or subleases vehicles to drivers and Lyft Rentals renters, and as a result, the Company considers itself to be the accounting lessor or sublessor, asapplicable, in these arrangements in accordance with ASC 842. Fleet operating costs include monthly fixed lease payments and other vehicle operating or ownership costs,as applicable.

The allowance for credit losses reflects the Company\u2019s current estimate of expected credit losses inherent in the enterprise andtrade  receivables  balance.  In  determining  the  expected  credit  losses,  the  Company  considers  its  historical  loss  experience,  the  aging  of  its  receivable  balance,  currenteconomic and business conditions, and anticipated future economic events that may impact collectability. The Company reviews its allowance for credit losses periodicallyand as needed, and amounts are written off when determined to be uncollectible.The Company\u2019s receivable balance, which consists primarily of amounts due from Enterprise Users, was $196.2 million, $104.7 million and $120.0 million as ofDecember 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Company's allowance for credit losses was $9.3 million, $15.2 million and $6.2 million as of December 31, 2021,2020 and 2019,  respectively.  The write-offs  were  immaterial  for  the  year  ended  December  31, 2021. The  change  in the  allowance  for  credit  losses  for  the  year  endedDecember 31, 2021 was related to $4.5 million of reductions for provision for expected credit losses and $1.4 million of write-offs. The change in the allowance for creditlosses for the year ended December 31, 2020 was related to $11.7 million of additions for provision for expected credit losses and $2.7 million of write-offs. The change inthe allowance for credit losses for the year ended December 31, 2019 was related to $5.1 million of additions for provision for expected credit losses and $1.5 million ofwrite-offs.Incentive ProgramsThe Company offers incentives to attract drivers, riders, Light Vehicle riders and Lyft Rentals renters to use the Lyft Platform. Drivers generally receive cashincentives  while  riders,  Light  Vehicle  riders  and  Lyft  Rentals  renters  generally  receive  free  or  discounted  rides  under  such  incentive  programs.  Incentives  provided  todrivers, Light Vehicle riders and Lyft Rental renters, the customers of the Company, are accounted for as a reduction of the transaction price. As the riders are not theCompany\u2019s customers, incentives provided to riders are generally recognized as sales and marketing expense except for certain pricing programs described below.Driver IncentivesThe  Company  offers  various  incentive  programs  to  drivers,  including  minimum  guaranteed  payments,  volume-based  discounts  and  performance-based  bonuspayments.  These  driver  incentives  are  similar  to  retrospective  volume-based  rebates  and  represent  variable  consideration  that  is  typically  settled  within  a  week.  TheCompany reduces the transaction price by the estimated amount of the incentives expected to be paid upon completion of the performance criteria by applying the mostlikely outcome method. Therefore, such driver incentives are recorded as a reduction to revenue. Driver incentives are recorded as a reduction to revenue if the Companydoes not receive a distinct good or service in exchange for the payment or cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of the good or service received. Driver incentives forreferring new drivers or riders are accounted for as sales and marketing expense. The amount recorded as an expense is the lesser of the amount of the payment or theestablished fair value of the benefit received. The fair value of the benefit is established using amounts paid to third parties for similar services.Rideshare Rider IncentivesThe Company has several rideshare rider incentive programs, which are offered to encourage rider activity on the Lyft Platform. Generally, the rider incentiveprograms are as follows:(i)Market-wide marketing promotions. Market-wide  promotions reduce the fare charged by drivers to riders for all or substantially all rides in a specific market.This type of incentive effectively reduces the overall pricing of the service provided by drivers for that specific market and the gross fare charged by thedriver to the rider, and thereby results in a lower fee earned by the Company. Accordingly, the Company records this type of incentive as a reduction torevenue at the date it records the corresponding revenue transaction.(ii)Targeted marketing promotions. Targeted  marketing promotions are used to promote the use of the Lyft Platform to a targeted group of riders.

An example isa promotion where the Company offers a number of discounted rides (capped at a given number of rides) which are valid only during a limited period of timeto a targeted group of riders. The Company believes that the incentives that provide consideration to riders to be applied to a limited number of rides aresimilar  to  marketing  coupons.  These  incentives  differ  from  the  market-wide  marketing  promotions  because  they  do  not  reduce  the  overall  pricing  of  theservice  provided  by  drivers  for  a  specific  market.  During  the  promotion  period,  riders  not  utilizing  an  incentive  would  be  charged  the  full  fare.  Theseincentives represent marketing costs. When a rider redeems the incentive, the Company recognizes revenue equal to the transaction price and the cost of theincentive is recorded as sales and marketing expense.(iii)Rider referral programs. Under  the rider referral program, the referring rider (the referrer) earns referral coupons when a new rider (the referee) completestheir first ride on the Lyft Platform. The Company records the incentive as a liability at the time the incentive is earned by the referrer with the correspondingcharge  recorded  to  sales  and  marketing  expense.  Referral  coupons typically  expire  within  one  year.  The  Company  estimates  breakage  using its  historicalexperience.

The expected term of the ESPPpurchase rights is estimated using the period from the beginning of the offering period to the end of each purchase period. Since the Company has limited history as apublic company and does not yet have sufficient trading history for the Company's common stock, the Company estimates volatility for stock options and ESPP purchaserights using the historical volatility of the stock price of similar publicly traded peer companies. The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield available on U.S. Treasuryzero-coupon issues similar in duration to the expected term of the stock options or ESPP purchase rights granted.The fair value of stock options that are expected to vest is recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line  basis over the requisite service period. TheCompany recognizes compensation expense related to the ESPP purchase rights on a straight-line basis over the offering period, which is typically 12 months.The fair value of RSUs and PSUs is estimated based on the fair market value of the Company\u2019s common stock on the date of grant, which subsequent to the IPO isdetermined based on the closing price of the Company\u2019s Class A common stock as reported on the date of grant. Prior to the IPO, the Company granted RSUs which vestupon the satisfaction of both a service condition and a performance condition.Compensation  expense  for  RSUs  with  service  and  performance  conditions  is  amortized  on  a  graded  basis  over  the  requisite  service  period  as  long  as  theperformance  condition  in  the  form  of  a  specified  liquidity  event  is  probable  to  occur.  The  liquidity  event  condition  was  satisfied  upon  the  effectiveness  of the  IPORegistration Statement on  March 28, 2019. On that date the Company recorded a cumulative stock-based compensation expense of $857.2 million using the acceleratedattribution method for the RSUs for which the service condition was satisfied as of March 28, 2019. The remaining unrecognized stock-based compensation expense relatedto these RSUs is recorded over their remaining requisite service periods. The compensation expense for RSUs granted after March 28, 2019, which vest upon satisfaction ofa service-based condition only, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.Stock-based compensation expense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest and reflects estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grantand revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from initial estimates.Income TaxesThe Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded based onthe estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial statement and income tax basis of existing assets and liabilities. These differences are measured usingthe enacted statutory tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which differences are expected to reverse. The Company recognizes the effect ondeferred income taxes of a change in tax rates in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets tothe net amount that it believes is more-likely-than-not to be realized. Management considers all available evidence, both positive and negative, including historical levels ofincome, expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance.Under the provisions of ASC 740-10, Income Taxes, the Company evaluates uncertain tax positions by reviewing against applicable tax law for all positions takenby the Company with respect to tax years for which the statute of limitations is still open. ASC 740-10 provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may berecognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based onthe technical merits. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, if any, as a component of the income tax expenseline in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.Business CombinationsThe Company accounts for its business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among other things, allocation of the fair valueof purchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date.

After the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are reflected on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Acquisitioncosts, such as legal and consulting fees, are expensed as incurred.Cash and Cash EquivalentsCash equivalents consist of institutional money market funds and certificates of deposits denominated in U.S. dollars as well as commercial paper and corporatebonds. Cash equivalents are highly liquid, short-term investments having an original maturity of 90 days or less that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash. Alsoincluded in cash and cash equivalents are cash in transit from payment processors for credit and debit card transactions, which was immaterial as of each of December 31,2021 and 2020, and money market deposit accounts that are stated at cost, which approximate fair value.Restricted Cash and Cash EquivalentsRestricted cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of amounts held in separate trust accounts and restricted bank accounts as collateral for insurance purposesand amounts pledged to secure certain letters of credit.InvestmentsDebt SecuritiesThe Company\u2019s accounting for its investments in debt securities is based on the legal form of the security, the Company\u2019s intended holding period for the security,and  the  nature  of  the  transaction.  Investments  in  debt  securities  include  commercial  paper,  certificates  of  deposit,  corporate  bonds  and  U.S.  government  securities.Investments in debt securities are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at fair value.The  Company  considers  an  available-for-sale  debt  security  to  be  impaired  if  the  fair  value  of  the  investment  is  less  than  its  amortized  cost  basis.  The  entiredifference between the amortized cost basis and the fair value of the Company\u2019s available-for-sale debt securities is recognized on the consolidated statements of operationsas an impairment if, (i) the fair value of the security is below its amortized cost and (ii) the Company intends to sell or is more likely than not required to sell the securitybefore recovery of its amortized cost basis. If neither criterion is met, the Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value is due to credit losses or other factors. Inmaking this assessment, the Company considers the extent to which the security\u2019s fair value is less than amortized cost, changes to the rating of the security by third-partyrating  agencies,  and  adverse  conditions  specific  to  the  security,  among  other  factors.  If  the  Company's  assessment  indicates  that  a  credit  loss  exists,  the  credit  loss  ismeasured  based  on  the  Company's  best  estimate  of  the  cash  flows  expected  to  be  collected.  When  developing  its  estimate  of  cash  flows  expected  to  be  collected,  theCompany  considers  all  available  information  relevant  to  the  collectability  of  the  security,  including  past  events,  current  conditions,  and  reasonable  and  supportableforecasts.Credit loss impairments are recognized through an allowance for credit losses adjustment to the amortized cost basis of the debt securities on the balance sheetwith an offsetting credit loss expense on the consolidated statements of operations. Impairments related to factors other than credit losses are recognized as an adjustment tothe amortized cost basis of the security and an offsetting amount in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax.

Although the Company deposits its cashwith multiple financial institutions, the deposits, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses on its deposits of cash and cashequivalents. Management believes that the institutions are financially stable and, accordingly, minimal credit risk exists. The Company limits purchases of debt securities toinvestment-grade securities.Fair Value MeasurementsThe Company measures assets and liabilities at fair value based on an expected exit price, which represents the amount that would be received on the sale of anasset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value may be based on assumptions that market participants woulduse in pricing an asset or liability. The authoritative guidance on fair value measurements establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value on either a recurringor nonrecurring basis, whereby inputs used in valuation techniques, are assigned a hierarchical level. The following are the hierarchical levels of inputs to measure fairvalue:Level 1Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.Level 2Inputs reflect quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; inputsother than quoted prices that are observable for the assets or liabilities; or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data bycorrelation or other means.Level 3Unobservable  inputs  reflecting  our  own  assumptions  incorporated  in  valuation  techniques  used  to  determine  fair  value.  These  assumptions  are  required  to  beconsistent with market participant assumptions that are reasonably available.The carrying values of the Company\u2019s accounts payable and accrued and other liabilities approximate their respective fair values due to the short period of time topayment.Light Vehicle FleetThe Company\u2019s Light Vehicle fleet consists of bikes and scooters. Scooters are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and are included in prepaid expensesand other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Depreciation is computed using a straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the scooters, which isless than 12 months. As of December 31, 2021, there were no scooters not yet placed in service. As of December 31, 2020, the cost of scooters not yet placed in service was$8.9 million. As of December 31, 2021, the carrying value of scooters placed in service was $15.3 million. As of December 31, 2020, the carrying value of scooters placedin service was not material. Depreciation expense related to scooters was $5.9 million, $7.2 million and $35.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and2019, respectively.

Due to the short-term nature of these arrangements, the Company classifies these leases as operating leases. The Company does not separate lease and non-leasecomponents, such as insurance or roadside assistance provided to the lessee, in its lessor lease arrangements. Lease payments are primarily fixed and are recognized asrevenue in the period over which the lease arrangement occurs. Taxes or other fees assessed by governmental authorities that are both imposed on and concurrent with eachlease revenue-producing transaction and collected by the Company from the lessee are excluded from the consideration in its lease arrangements. The Company mitigatesresidual value risk of its leased assets by performing regular maintenance and repairs, as necessary, and through periodic reviews of asset depreciation rates based on theCompany's ongoing assessment of present and estimated future market conditions.LesseeThe Company's leases include real estate property to support its operations and Flexdrive vehicles that may be used by drivers to provide ridesharing services onthe Lyft Platform or renters for personal reasons through Lyft Rentals. For leases with a term greater than 12 months, the Company records the related right-of-use assetand lease liability at the present value of lease payments over the term. The lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certainthat the Company will exercise such options. The Company does not separate lease and non-lease components of contracts for real estate property leases, but has elected todo so for vehicle leases when non-lease components exist in these arrangements. For certain leases, the Company also applies a portfolio approach to account for right-of-use assets and lease liabilities that are similar in nature and have nearly identical contract provisions.The Company\u2019s leases do not provide a readily determinable implicit rate. Therefore, the Company estimates its incremental borrowing rate to discount the leasepayments based on information available at lease commencement. The Company determines its incremental borrowing rate based on the rate of interest that the Companywould have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term for an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment.Lease payments may be fixed or variable; however, only fixed payments are included in the Company\u2019s lease liability calculation. Operating leases are included inoperating lease right-of-use assets, operating lease liabilities \u2014 current and operating lease liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Lease costs for the Company'soperating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis primarily within operating expenses over the lease term. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, net,accrued and other current liabilities, and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Finance lease assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of theestimated useful lives of the assets or the lease term in cost of revenue on the consolidated statements of operations. The interest component of finance leases is included incost of revenue on the consolidated statements of operations and recognized using the effective interest method over the lease term. Variable lease payments are recognizedprimarily in operating expenses in the period in which the obligation for those payments are incurred.Property and EquipmentProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using a straight-line method over the estimated useful life ofthe  related  asset,  which  is  generally  between two  and  seven  years.  Depreciation  for  property  and  equipment  commences  once  they  are  ready  for  our  intended  use.Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred, and improvements and betterments are capitalized.

Such  events  and  changes  may  include:  significant  changes  in  performancerelative to expected operating results, changes in asset use, negative industry or economic trends, and changes in the Company\u2019s business strategy. The Company measuresrecoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows that the assets or the asset group are expected to generate. If thecarrying value of the assets are not recoverable, the impairment recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Therewas no impairment of long-lived assets recorded for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.Software Development CostsThe Company incurs costs related to developing the Lyft Platform and related support systems. The Company capitalizes development costs related to the LyftPlatform and related support systems once the preliminary project stage is complete and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used toperform the function intended. The Company capitalized $16.2 million and $12.8 million of software development costs during the year ended December 31, 2021 and2020, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2019, capitalized software development costs was not material.Insurance ReservesThe Company utilizes both a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary and third-party insurance, which may include deductibles and self-insured retentions, toinsure or reinsure costs including auto liability, uninsured and underinsured motorist, auto physical damage, first party injury coverages including personal injury protectionunder state law and general business liabilities up to certain limits. The recorded liabilities reflect the estimated cost for claims incurred but not paid and claims that havebeen  incurred  but  not  yet  reported  and  any  estimable  administrative  run-out  expenses  related  to  the  processing  of  these  outstanding  claim  payments.  Liabilities  aredetermined on a quarterly basis by internal actuaries through an analysis of historical trends, changes in claims experience including consideration of new information andapplication of loss development factors among other inputs and assumptions. On an annual basis or more frequently as determined by management, an independent third-party actuary will evaluate the liabilities for appropriateness with claims reserve valuations.Insurance  claims  may  take  years  to  completely  settle,  and the  Company has limited  historical  loss  experience.  Because  of the  limited  operational  history,  theCompany  makes  certain  assumptions  based  on  currently  available  information  and  industry  statistics,  with  the  loss  development  factors  as  one  of  the  most  significantassumptions, and utilizes actuarial models and techniques to estimate the reserves. A number of factors can affect the actual cost of a claim, including the length of time theclaim remains open, economic and healthcare cost trends and the results of related litigation. Furthermore, claims may emerge in future years for events that occurred in aprior year at a rate that differs from previous actuarial projections. The impact of these factors on ultimate costs for insurance is difficult to estimate and could be material.However, while the Company believes that the insurance reserve amount is adequate, the ultimate liability may be in excess of, or less than, the amount provided. As aresult, the net amounts that will ultimately be paid to settle the liability and when amounts will be paid may significantly vary from the estimated amounts provided for onthe consolidated balance sheets. The Company continues to review its insurance estimates in a regular, ongoing process as historical loss experience develops, additionalclaims are reported and settled, and the legal, regulatory and economic environment evolves.Net Loss Per ShareThe Company follows the two-class method when computing net loss per common share when shares are issued that meet the definition of participating securities.The two-class method determines net loss per common share for each class of common stock and participating securities according to dividends declared or accumulatedand participation rights in undistributed earnings.

There were no redeemable convertible preferred shares issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period, less sharessubject to repurchase. The diluted net loss per share is computed by giving effect to all potentially dilutive securities outstanding for the period. For periods in which theCompany reports net losses, diluted net loss per common share attributable to common stockholders is the same as basic net loss per common share attributable to commonstockholders, because potentially dilutive common shares are not assumed to have been issued if their effect is anti-dilutive.94", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3810, "end_char_idx": 5894, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "500d6898-30a5-4720-9134-3dbd9222a0a6": {"__data__": {"id_": "500d6898-30a5-4720-9134-3dbd9222a0a6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "95", "file_name": "lyft_2021.pdf", "file_path": "/media/mtl/Volume F/PROJECTS/projects/Func_Call/pdf/lyft_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1440303, "creation_date": "2025-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ec967ec4-02b0-45cc-aa80-6c13a7696076", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "95", "file_name": "lyft_2021.pdf", "file_path": "/media/mtl/Volume F/PROJECTS/projects/Func_Call/pdf/lyft_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1440303, "creation_date": "2025-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-28"}, "hash": "d8ec7568c90af4370cc97a5dbef50c297b0de56419736c8cc9be0a20d85360cb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "08f80cd6-c674-409a-98e6-21138084bdaa", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b5eb5f5ea9391aa8fc01bef289d774792ceab898edb2da3d3060bc1d13644ef4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Recent Accounting Pronouncements\nRecently Adopted Accounting PronouncementsIn  December  2019,  the  FASB  issued  ASU  No.  2019-12,  \"Income  Taxes  (Topic  740):  Simplifying  the  Accounting  for  Income  Taxes\",  which  removes  certainexceptions to the general principles in Topic 740 and improves consistent application of and simplifies GAAP for other areas of Topic 740 by clarifying and amendingexisting guidance.

This preexisting contractual relationship and others were settled on the Closing Date as an adjustment to the purchaseprice, resulting in a total acquisition consideration paid of $13.0 million.95", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3289, "end_char_idx": 6049, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fbb50a0d-f18a-471c-96d4-06d468579bd7": {"__data__": {"id_": "fbb50a0d-f18a-471c-96d4-06d468579bd7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "96", "file_name": "lyft_2021.pdf", "file_path": "/media/mtl/Volume F/PROJECTS/projects/Func_Call/pdf/lyft_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1440303, "creation_date": "2025-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e070138a-a3e7-40c4-b7f5-f7f7413520c8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "96", "file_name": "lyft_2021.pdf", "file_path": "/media/mtl/Volume F/PROJECTS/projects/Func_Call/pdf/lyft_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1440303, "creation_date": "2025-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-28"}, "hash": "f574c0fda814909f6bbc391b5cbb169298a0ddb0534aca0e1802438ec6afec4e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Acquisition costs were imma\nterial and are included in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of operations.The following table summarizes the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the Closing Date (in thousands):Cash and cash equivalents$ 587 Prepaid expenses and other current assets276 Property and equipment111,881 Finance lease right-of-use assets56,014 Identifiable intangible assets - developed technology13,200 Total identifiable assets acquired181,958 Loans134,121 Finance lease & other liabilities57,265 Total liabilities assumed191,386 Net liabilities assumed(9,428) Goodwill22,455 Total acquisition consideration$ 13,027 Goodwill  represents  the  excess  of  the  total  purchase  consideration  over  the  fair  value  of  the  underlying  assets  acquired  and  liabilities  assumed.  Goodwill  isattributable to expected synergies and monetization opportunities from gaining control over the Flexdrive platform (\u201cdeveloped technology\u201d intangible asset) and gaininggreater flexibility in monetizing the fleet of owned and leased vehicles from the combined operations of the Company and Flexdrive. The acquisition is a taxable businesscombination for tax purposes and goodwill recognized in the acquisition is deductible for tax purposes.The fair value of the developed technology intangible asset was determined to be $13.2 million with an estimated useful life of three years. The fair value of thedeveloped technology was determined using the avoided cost approach. In the avoided cost approach, the fair value of an asset is based on the future after-tax costs whichare avoided (or reduced) as a result of owning (or having the rights to) the asset for three years after the Closing Date. Indications of value were developed by discountingthese benefits to their present value.The results of operations for the acquired business have been included on the consolidated statements of operations for the period subsequent to the Company'sacquisition  of  Flexdrive.  Flexdrive's  results  of  operations  for  periods  prior  to  this  acquisition  were  not  material  to  the  consolidated  statements  of  operations  and,accordingly, pro forma financial information has not been presented.Other AcquisitionsIn the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company completed two business combinations which are not material to the consolidated financial statements.Pro  forma  results  of  operations  have  not  been  presented  because  the  effects  of  the  acquisitions  were  not  material  to  the  Company\u2019s  consolidated  financialstatements.4. DivestituresTransaction with Woven Planet Holdings, Inc. (\u201cWoven Planet\u201d)On July 13, 2021, the Company completed a multi-element transaction with Woven Planet, a subsidiary of Toyota Motor Corporation, for the divestiture of certainassets related to the Company\u2019s self-driving vehicle division, Level 5, as well as commercial agreements for the utilization of Lyft rideshare and fleet data to accelerate thesafety and commercialization of the automated-driving vehicles that Woven Planet is developing. The Company will receive, in total, approximately $515 million in cash inconnection with this transaction, with $165 million paid upfront and $350 million to be paid over a five-year period.The  divestiture  did  not  represent  a  strategic  shift  with  a  major  effect  on  the  Company\u2019s  operations  and  financial  results,  and  therefore,  does  not  qualify  forreporting  as  a  discontinued  operation.  As  the  transaction  included  multiple  elements,  the  Company  had  to  estimate  how  much  of  the  arrangement  consideration  wasattributable  to  the  divestiture  of  certain  assets  related  to  the  Level  5  division  and  how  much  was  attributable  to  the  commercial  agreements  for  the  utilization  of  Lyftrideshare and fleet data. The Company recognized a $119.3 million pre-tax gain for the divestiture of certain assets related to the Level 5 division, which was based on therelative fair value of the Level 5 division, valued under the replacement cost method, and the estimated standalone selling price of the rideshare and fleet data, valued usingan adjusted market approach.. The significant assumptions related to the obsolescence curve used to estimate the fair value of the Level 5 division assets and the estimatedmiles to recreate the data produced from the rideshare license used to determine the stand alone selling price of the rideshare data. The gain was included in other income,net on96", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4558, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a5b80182-d011-4adf-9488-e18f856ee49d": {"__data__": {"id_": "a5b80182-d011-4adf-9488-e18f856ee49d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "97", "file_name": "lyft_2021.pdf", "file_path": "/media/mtl/Volume F/PROJECTS/projects/Func_Call/pdf/lyft_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1440303, "creation_date": "2025-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4c578179-7b75-4624-9ca7-3a4692c69b68", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "97", "file_name": "lyft_2021.pdf", "file_path": "/media/mtl/Volume F/PROJECTS/projects/Func_Call/pdf/lyft_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1440303, "creation_date": "2025-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-28"}, "hash": "08cd627861af613311ff66fb7f76923988173a18388dbd1ef334ce8dcd2da0e9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "the\n consolidated  statement  of  operations  for  the  quarter  ended  September  30,  2021.

This policy is designed to minimize the Company's exposure to credit losses. As of December 31, 2021, the credit-quality of the Company\u2019smarketable available-for-sale debt securities had remained stable. The unrealized losses recognized on marketable available-for-sale debt securities as of December 31,2021 was primarily related to the continued market volatility associated with COVID-19. The contractual terms of these investments do not permit the issuer to settle thesecurities at a price less than the amortized cost basis of the investments and it is not expected that the investments would be settled at a price less than their amortized costbasis. The Company does not intend to sell the investments and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the investments before recovery oftheir amortized cost basis.

Under the terms of the Reinsurance Agreement,PVIC ceded to DARAG approximately $251.3 million of certain legacy insurance liabilities for policies underwritten during the period of October 1, 2018 to October 1,2020, with an aggregate limit of $434.5 million, for a premium of $271.5 million (\u201cthe Reinsurance Transaction\u201d).

These  renewal  options  are  not  considered  in  the  remaining  lease  term  unless  it  is  reasonably  certain  that  theCompany will exercise such options. For leases with an initial term of 12 months or longer, the Company has recorded a right-of-use asset and lease liability representingthe fixed component of the lease payment. Any fixed payments related to non-lease components, such as common area maintenance  or other services provided by thelandlord, are accounted for as a component of the lease payment and therefore, a part of the total lease cost.Flexdrive ProgramThe Company operates a fleet of rental vehicles through Flexdrive, a portion of which are leased from third-party vehicle leasing companies.

The Company has agreed toindemnify and defend the indemnified party\u2019s claims and related losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party resulting from actual or threatened third-party claimsbecause of the Company\u2019s activities or, in some cases, non-compliance with certain representations and warranties made by the Company. It is not possible to determine themaximum  potential  loss  under  these  indemnification  provisions  due  to  the  Company\u2019s  limited  history  of  prior  indemnification  claims  and  the  unique  facts  andcircumstances involved in each particular provision. To date, losses recorded on the consolidated statements of operations in connection with the indemnification provisionshave not been material.Legal ProceedingsThe Company is currently involved in, and may in the future be involved in, legal proceedings, claims, regulatory inquiries, and governmental investigations in theordinary course of business, including suits by drivers, riders, renters, or third parties (individually or as class actions) alleging, among other things, various wage andexpense related claims, violations of state or federal laws, improper disclosure of the Company\u2019s fees, rules or policies, that such fees, rules or policies violate applicablelaw,  or  that  the  Company  has  not  acted  in  conformity  with  such  fees,  rules  or  policies,  as  well  as  proceedings  related  to  product  liability,  its  acquisitions,  securitiesissuances or business practices, or public disclosures about the business. In addition, the Company has been, and is currently, named as a defendant in a number of litigationmatters related to accidents or other trust and safety incidents involving drivers or riders using the Lyft Platform.The outcomes of the Company\u2019s legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. For some matters for which a material lossis  reasonably  possible,  an  estimate  of  the  amount  of  loss  or  range  of  losses  is  not  possible  nor  is  the  Company  able  to  estimate  the  loss  or  range  of  losses  that  couldpotentially result from the application of nonmonetary remedies. Until the final resolution of legal matters, there may be an exposure to a material loss in excess of theamount recorded.Independent Contractor Classification MattersWith regard to independent contractor classification of drivers on the Lyft Platform, the Company is regularly subject to claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings,administrative actions, government investigations and other legal and regulatory proceedings at the federal, state and municipal levels challenging the classification of thesedrivers as independent contractors, and claims that, by the alleged misclassification, the Company has violated various labor and other laws that would apply to driveremployees.  Laws  and  regulations  that  govern  the  status  and  classification  of  independent  contractors  are  subject  to  change  and  divergent  interpretations  by  variousauthorities, which can create uncertainty and unpredictability for the Company.For  example,  Assembly  Bill  5  (as  codified  in  part  at  Cal.  Labor  Code  sec.  2750.3)  codified  and  extended  an  employment  classification  test  set  forth  by  theCalifornia Supreme Court that established a new standard for determining employee or independent contractor status. The passage of this bill led to additional challenges tothe independent contractor classification of drivers using the Lyft Platform.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4046, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d5011441-593d-45a3-9022-d4bb75d4d701": {"__data__": {"id_": "d5011441-593d-45a3-9022-d4bb75d4d701", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "108", "file_name": "lyft_2021.pdf", "file_path": "/media/mtl/Volume F/PROJECTS/projects/Func_Call/pdf/lyft_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1440303, "creation_date": "2025-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "702463cd-5da7-4a8e-902c-5fc3d26f50b4", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "108", "file_name": "lyft_2021.pdf", "file_path": "/media/mtl/Volume F/PROJECTS/projects/Func_Call/pdf/lyft_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1440303, "creation_date": "2025-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-28"}, "hash": "1bea788e5f19fcdaa99f67dee778732aefee78105e8480d2247d29e79f343555", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f260c2f7-d847-43d4-bcf6-a2a80f3cf497", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "108", "file_name": "lyft_2021.pdf", "file_path": "/media/mtl/Volume F/PROJECTS/projects/Func_Call/pdf/lyft_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1440303, "creation_date": "2025-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-28"}, "hash": "6dd318942993c6577a5935dc2c36877012c9642a777ef54ed1bc10875db46720", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Laws  and  regulations  that  govern  the  status  and  classification  of  independent  contractors  are  subject  to  change  and  divergent  interpretations  by  variousauthorities, which can create uncertainty and unpredictability for the Company.For  example,  Assembly  Bill  5  (as  codified  in  part  at  Cal.

The passage of this bill led to additional challenges tothe independent contractor classification of drivers using the Lyft Platform. For example, on May 5, 2020, the California Attorney General and the City Attorneys of LosAngeles,  San  Diego  and  San  Francisco  filed  a  lawsuit  against  the  Company  and  Uber  for  allegedly  misclassifying  drivers  on  the  companies\u2019  respective  platforms  asindependent  contractors  in  violation  of  Assembly  Bill  5  and  California\u2019s  Unfair  Competition  Law,  and  on  August  5,  2020,  the  California  Labor  Commissioner  filedlawsuits against the Company and Uber for allegedly misclassifying drivers on the companies\u2019 respective platforms as independent contractors, seeking injunctive reliefand material damages and penalties. On August 10, 2020, the court granted a motion for a preliminary injunction, forcing the Company and Uber to reclassify drivers inCalifornia as employees until the end of the lawsuit. Subsequently, voters in California approved Proposition 22, a state ballot initiative that provided a framework fordrivers utilizing platforms like Lyft to maintain their status as independent contractors under California law. Proposition 22 went into effect on December 16, 2020. OnApril 20, 2021, the court granted the parties\u2019 joint request to dissolve the preliminary injunction in light of the passage of Proposition 22. On May 3, 2021, the CaliforniaLabor Commissioner filed a petition to coordinate its lawsuit with the Attorney General lawsuit and three other cases against the Company and Uber. The coordinationpetition was granted and the coordinated cases have been assigned to a judge in San Francisco Superior Court. On January 12, 2021, a separate lawsuit was filed in theCalifornia Supreme Court against the State of California alleging that Proposition 22 is unconstitutional under the California Constitution. The California Supreme Courtdenied review on February 3, 2021. Plaintiffs then filed a similar lawsuit in Alameda County Superior Court on February 12, 2021. Protect App-Based Drivers & Services(PADS) -- the coalition that established and operated the official ballot measure committee that successfully advocated for the passage of Proposition 22 -- intervened in theAlameda lawsuit. On August 20, 2021, after a merits hearing, the Alameda Superior Court issued an order finding that Proposition 22 is unenforceable. Both the CaliforniaAttorney General and PADS have filed appeals to the California Court of Appeal. Briefing is currently underway. Separately, on July 14, 2020, the Massachusetts AttorneyGeneral filed a lawsuit against the Company and Uber for allegedly misclassifying drivers as independent contractors under Massachusetts law, and seeking declaratory andinjunctive relief. The Company and Uber filed motions to dismiss, which were denied by the court in March 2021.

Certain adverse outcomes of such actions would have a material impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial conditionand  results  of  operations,  including  damages,  penalties  and  potential  suspension  of  operations  in  impacted  jurisdictions,  including  California  or  Massachusetts.  TheCompany\u2019s chances of success on the merits are still uncertain and any possible loss or range of loss cannot be reasonably estimated. Such regulatory scrutiny or actionmay create different or conflicting obligations from one jurisdiction to another.The Company is currently  involved in a number of putative  class actions,  thousands of individual  claims,  including  those brought in arbitration  or compelledpursuant to the Company's Terms of Service to arbitration, matters brought, in whole or in part, as representative actions under California\u2019s Private Attorney General Act,Labor Code Section 2698, et seq., alleging that the Company misclassified drivers as independent contractors and other matters challenging the classification of drivers onthe  Company\u2019s platform  as independent  contractors.  The Company is currently  defending  allegations  in a number of lawsuits  that  the Company has failed  to properlyclassify drivers and provide those drivers with sick leave and related benefits during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company\u2019s chances of success on the merits are stilluncertain and any possible loss or range of loss cannot be reasonably estimated.The  Company  disputes  any  allegations  of  wrongdoing  and  intends  to  continue  to  defend  itself  vigorously  in  these  matters.  However,  results  of  litigation,arbitration and regulatory actions are inherently unpredictable and legal proceedings related to these driver claims, individually or in the aggregate, could have a materialimpact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. Regardless of the outcome, litigation and arbitration of these matters can have an adverseimpact on the Company because of defense and settlement costs individually and in the aggregate, diversion of management resources and other factors.Unemployment Insurance AssessmentThe Company is involved in administrative audits with various state employment agencies, including audits related to driver classification, in California, Oregon,Wisconsin,  Illinois,  New  York,  New  Jersey  and  North  Carolina.  The  Company  believes  that  drivers  are  properly  classified  as  independent  contractors  and  plans  tovigorously contest any adverse assessment or determination. The Company\u2019s chances of success on the merits are still uncertain. The Company accrues liabilities that mayresult from assessments by, or any negotiated agreements with, these employment agencies when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable, and the expense is recordedto general and administrative expenses.Indirect TaxesThe Company is under audit by various domestic tax authorities with regard to indirect tax matters. The subject matter of indirect tax audits primarily arises fromdisputes  on  tax  treatment  and  tax  rates  applied  to  the  sale  of  the  Company\u2019s  services  in  these  jurisdictions.  The  Company  accrues  indirect  taxes  that  may  result  fromexaminations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax authorities when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable and the expense is recorded to general andadministrative expenses.Patent LitigationThe Company is currently involved in legal proceedings related to alleged infringement of patents and other intellectual property and, in the ordinary course ofbusiness, the Company receives correspondence from other purported holders of patents and other intellectual property offering to license such property and/or assertinginfringement of such property. The Company disputes any allegation of wrongdoing and intends to defend itself vigorously in these matters. The Company\u2019s chances ofsuccess on the merits are still uncertain and any possible loss or range of loss cannot be reasonably estimated.Consumer and Other Class ActionsThe Company is involved in a number of class actions alleging violations of consumer protection laws such as the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, orTCPA, as well as violations of other laws such as the Americans with Disabilities Act, or the ADA, seeking injunctive or other relief. Recently, the Company received afavorable outcome in a case in the Northern District of California alleging ADA violations with respect to Lyft\u2019s wheelchair accessible vehicle offerings in three Bay Areacounties, Independent Living Resource Center San Francisco (\u201cILRC\u201d) v.

The putative class actions have been consolidated into two putative class actions, one in California state court and the other infederal court. The derivative actions have also been consolidated into one action in federal court in California. On July 1, 2020, the California state court sustained in partand overruled in part the Company's demurrer to the consolidated complaint. The Company filed its answer to this consolidated complaint on August 3, 2020. On February26, 2021, the California state court struck additional allegations from the consolidated complaint and granted plaintiffs leave to amend, and plaintiffs filed an amendedcomplaint on March 17, 2021. The Company filed its demurrer and motion to strike the amended claim on April 13, 2021, and on July 16, 2021, the California state courtoverruled the demurrer but struck additional allegations from the consolidated complaint and granted plaintiffs leave to amend. The state court plaintiffs filed their renewedmotion to certify a class action on June 24, 2021, and on January 25, 2022, the court denied plaintiffs\u2019 motion without prejudice and stayed the case in light of the certifiedclass action proceeding in federal court. In the California federal court class action, on May 14, 2020, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated complaintand on September 8, 2020, the federal court granted in part and denied in part that motion.

The Company believes that, based on a number of factors, the available objective evidence creates sufficient uncertainty regarding the realizability ofthe deferred tax assets such that a valuation allowance has been recorded. These factors include the Company\u2019s history of net losses since its inception.As of December 31, 2021, the Company had U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $7.5 billion and $6.7 billion, respectively.The federal net operating loss carryforwards generated through December 31, 2017 expire at various dates beginning in 2030 and will continue to expire through2037, while federal net operating loss carryforwards generated in 2018 or later do not expire. The state net operating loss carryovers will begin to expire in 2022 and willcontinue to expire at various times depending upon individual state carryforward rules. Utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards are subject to various limitationsdue to the ownership change limitations provided by Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 382 and similar state provisions.The Company is subject to taxation in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. All net operating losses generated to date are subject to adjustment forU.S. federal and state income tax purposes. Additionally, all tax years remain open to examination as of December 31, 2021.The Company has not provided foreign  withholding  taxes  on the  undistributed  earnings  of its  foreign  subsidiaries  as of December  31, 2021, 2020, and 2019,because it intends to permanently reinvest such earnings outside of the U.S. If these foreign earnings were to be repatriated in the future, the related U.S. tax liability will beimmaterial, due to the participation exemption put in place by the 2017 Tax Act.The Company\u2019s policy is to recognize interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax benefits as part of the income tax provision and include accrued interestand penalties with the related income tax liability on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets. To date, the Company has not recognized any interest and penalties in itsconsolidated statements of operations, nor has it accrued for or made payments for interest and penalties.

This was offset by a $22.9 million charge related to the accelerated vesting of certain equity awards for employees who were terminated, resultingin a net stock-based compensation benefit of $49.8 million. Additionally, the Company recognized other restructuring charges including severance and other employeecosts of $32.1 million as well as lease termination and other restructuring charges of $3.1 million. As a result of the above, the Company recognized a net restructuringbenefit of $14.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2020.The following table summarizes the above restructuring related charges (benefits) by line item within the Company\u2019s consolidated statements of operations wherethey were recorded in the year ended December 31, 2020 (in thousands):Stock-Based Compensation BenefitSeverance and Other Employee CostsLease Termination and Other CostsTotal Cost of revenue$ (4,237) $2,010 $1,529 $(698) Operation and support(2,830) 8,281 1,060 6,511 Research and development(37,082) 11,706 \u2014 (25,376) Sales and marketing(1,626) 3,071 \u2014 1,445 General and administrative(4,031) 7,062 539 3,570 Total$ (49,806) $32,130 $3,128 $(14,548) November 2020 Restructuring PlanIn November 2020, the Company announced an additional restructuring plan to reduce operating expenses and adjust cash flows in light of the ongoing economicchallenges resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the Company\u2019s business.

Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.\nNone.Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and ProceduresOur management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controlsand procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act), as of the end of the periodcovered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on such evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that, as of December31, 2021, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level.Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control Over Financial ReportingOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)under the Exchange Act). Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reportingand the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.Our management, under the supervision of our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internalcontrol over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021 based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013), issued by the Committee of SponsoringOrganizations  of  the  Treadway  Commission.  Based  on  this  evaluation,  management  concluded  that  our  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  was  effective  as  ofDecember 31, 2021.The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independentregistered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Changes in Internal Control Over Financial ReportingThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management\u2019s evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) of theExchange Act during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2021 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financialreporting.Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and ProceduresOur management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internalcontrol over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefitsof controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance thatall control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and thatbreakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or morepeople or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events,and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequatebecause of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Due to inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system,misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.Item 9B. Other Information.None.Item 9C.

AGREEMENT\n1.Disputes Subject To ArbitrationLyft and I hereby agree that any and all claims, disputes or controversies between  Lyft and me that arise out of or are related in any way to myemployment relationship with Lyft (except those excluded below) shall be resolved by final and binding arbitration. For purposes of this MutualArbitration Agreement (the \"Arbitration Agreement\"), references to Lyft shall include Lyft, Inc., and/or any entity affiliated with or related to Lyft,Inc. (including their owners, officers, directors, managers, employees, agents, fiduciaries, administrators, affiliates, subsidiaries, parents, and allsuccessors and assigns of any of them). This Arbitration Agreement is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and survives after the Agreementterminates or my relationship with Lyft ends. Any  arbitration under the Arbitration Agreement will take place on an individual basis; classarbitrations and class actions are not permitted. Lyft and I further expressly waive the right to a jury trial, and Lyft and I agree that thearbitrator's award will be final and binding on both parties.This Arbitration Agreement is intended to be broadly interpreted. The types of disputes and claims covered by this Arbitration Agreement (referredto below as \"Claims\") include, but are not limited to disputes over rights provided by federal, state, or local statutes, regulations, ordinances, andcommon  law;  claims  related  to  salary,  overtime,  bonuses,  vacation,  paid  time  off,  wages,  meal  and  rest  breaks,  and  any  other  form  ofcompensation;  claims  for  breach  of  contract,  wrongful  discharge,  fraud,  defamation,  emotional distress,  retaliation  and  breach  of  the  impliedcovenant of good faith and fair dealing; and claims involving laws that prohibit discrimination  and unlawful harassment based on any protectedclassification, including claims under Title Vll of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Age Discrimination inEmployment  Act,  the  Older  Workers  Benefit  Protection  Act,  and  any  state  employment  statutes,  such  as  the  California  Fair  Employment  &Housing Act, and the California Labor Code.2.Disputes Excluded From ArbitrationThis  Arbitration  Agreement  does  not  cover  claims  for  disability  and  medical  benefits  under  workers'  compensation  laws  or  claims  forunemployment benefits. Likewise, nothing in this Arbitration Agreement prohibits me from filing an administrative charge with the federal EqualEmployment Opportunity Commission,U.S.  Department  of  Labor,  Securities  Exchange  Commission,  National  Labor  Relations  Board,  the  Office  of  Federal  Contract  CompliancePrograms, the California Department of Fair Employment & Housing, or any other similar local, state, or federal agency, or from participating inany administrative agency investigation. Notwithstanding this Arbitration Provision, either Lyft or I may seek to obtain injunctive relief in court toavoid irreparable harm that might take place prior to the resolution of any arbitration.3.Class Action/Collective Action WaiverLyft and I agree to bring any Claims in arbitration on an individual basis only, and not on a class or collective basis. Accordingly, neither Inor Lyft shall bring, nor shall the arbitrator preside over, any form  of class or collective proceeding. In addition, unless all parties agree inwriting otherwise, the arbitrator shall not consolidate or join the arbitrations of more than one employee.

For purposes of this MutualArbitration Agreement (the \u201cArbitration Agreement\u201d), references to Lyft shall include Lyft, Inc., and/or any entity affiliated with or related toLyft, Inc. (including their owners, officers, directors, managers, employees, agents, fiduciaries, administrators, affiliates, subsidiaries, parents,and all successors and assigns of any of them). This Arbitration Agreement is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and survives after theAgreement terminates or my relationship with Lyft ends. Any  arbitration under the Arbitration Agreement will take place on an individualbasis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted. Lyft and I further expressly waive the right to a jury trial, and Lyft and Iagree that the arbitrator's award will be final and binding on both parties.This  Arbitration  Agreement  is  intended  to  be  broadly  interpreted.  The  types  of  disputes  and  claims  covered  by  this  Arbitration  Agreement(referred  to  below  as  \u201cClaims\u201d)  include,  but  are  not  limited  to  disputes  over  rights  provided  by  federal,  state,  or  local  statutes,  regulations,ordinances, and common law; claims related to salary, overtime, bonuses, vacation, paid time off, wages, meal and rest breaks, and any otherform  of  compensation;  claims  for  breach  of  contract,  wrongful  discharge,  fraud,  defamation,  emotional  distress,  retaliation  and  breach  of  theimplied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; and claims involving laws that prohibit discrimination and unlawful harassment based on anyprotected  classification,  including  claims  under  Title  VII  of  the  Civil  Rights  Act  of  1964,  the  Americans  with  Disabilities  Act,  the  AgeDiscrimination in Employment Act, the Older Workers Benefit Protection Act, and any state employment statutes, such as the California FairEmployment & Housing Act, and the California Labor Code.2.Disputes Excluded From ArbitrationThis  Arbitration  Agreement  does  not  cover  claims  for  disability  and  medical  benefits  under  workers\u2019  compensation  laws  or  claims  forunemployment benefits. Likewise, nothing in this Arbitration Agreement prohibits me from filing an administrative charge with the federal EqualEmployment Opportunity Commission,U.S.  Department  of  Labor,  Securities  Exchange  Commission,  National  Labor  Relations  Board,  the  Office  of  Federal  Contract  CompliancePrograms, the California Department of Fair Employment & Housing, or any other similar local, state, or federal agency, or from participating inany administrative agency investigation. Notwithstanding this Arbitration Provision, either Lyft or I may seek to obtain injunctive relief in courtto avoid irreparable harm that might take place prior to the resolution of any arbitration.3.Class Action/Collective Action WaiverLyft and I agree to bring any Claims in arbitration on an individual basis only, and not on a class or collective basis. Accordingly, neitherI nor Lyft shall bring, nor shall the arbitrator preside over, any form of class or collective proceeding. In addition, unless all partiesagree in writing otherwise, the arbitrator shall not consolidate or join the arbitrations of more than one employee. Neither  I nor Lyft mayseek, nor may the arbitrator award, any relief that is not individualized to the claimant or that affects other employees.Notwithstanding any other provision of this Arbitration Agreement, the scope, applicability, enforceability, revocability or validity of this sectionmay be resolved only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. If a court decides that applicable law does not permit theenforcement of any of this section\u2019s limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from thearbitration and may be brought in court.4.Representative PAGA WaiverTo the fullest extent permitted by law, Lyft and I (1) agree not to bring a representative action on behalf of others under the Private Attorneys General Act of 2004 (\u201cPAGA\u201d), California Labor Code \u00a7 2698 et seq ., in", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4439, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1570ddef-6030-4b8a-9375-3e55c36aada4": {"__data__": {"id_": "1570ddef-6030-4b8a-9375-3e55c36aada4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "206", "file_name": "lyft_2021.pdf", "file_path": "/media/mtl/Volume F/PROJECTS/projects/Func_Call/pdf/lyft_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1440303, "creation_date": "2025-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9950aedd-8ef8-4974-ab65-20f6859dc69b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "206", "file_name": "lyft_2021.pdf", "file_path": "/media/mtl/Volume F/PROJECTS/projects/Func_Call/pdf/lyft_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1440303, "creation_date": "2025-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-28"}, "hash": "9ca828b94d41adebd02ace65a85407cc068f8d4dd72f67cf9a21e83470a18d11", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "any court or\n in arbitration, and (2) agree that for any claim brought on a private attorney general basis, including under the California PAGA, any such dispute shall be resolved in arbitration on an individual basis only ( i.e., to resolve whether I have personally been aggrieved or subjectto any violations of law), and that such an action may not be used to resolve the claims or rights of other individuals in a single or collectiveproceeding  (i.e.,  to  resolve  whether  other  individuals  have  been  aggrieved  or  subject  to  any  violations  of  law)  (collectively,  \u201crepresentativePAGA  Waiver\u201d).

The arbitrator, in his or her sole discretion, may permit any discovery necessary to allow either party to have a fair opportunity to pursuethat party\u2019s claims and defenses.6.Paying For The ArbitrationThe AAA\u2019s rules will govern the amount and allocation of fees for the arbitration, subject to the provisions of this section. Lyft will pay any coststhat are unique to the arbitration process, including fees for the arbitrator\u2019s time and use of an arbitration forum. I will pay any costs that I amrequired to pay under the AAA rules that would be imposed on me in a judicial forum, but in no event shall the AAA filing fee that I amresponsible for paying exceed the filing fees that I would have paid if I had filed a complaint in a court of law having jurisdiction.
