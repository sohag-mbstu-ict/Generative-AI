BUSINESSOverviewUber Technologies, Inc. (\u201cUber,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d or \u201cus\u201d) is a technology platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, operational excellence andproduct expertise to power movement from point A to point B. We develop and operate proprietary technology applications supporting a variety of offerings onour  platform  (\u201cplatform(s)\u201d  or  \u201cPlatform(s)\u201d).  We  connect  consumers  (\u201cRider(s)\u201d)  with  independent  providers  of  ride  services  (\u201cMobility  Driver(s)\u201d)  forridesharing  services,  and  connect  Riders  and  other  consumers  (\u201cEater(s)\u201d)  with  restaurants,  grocers  and  other  stores  (collectively,  \u201cMerchants\u201d)  with  deliveryservice  providers  (\u201cCouriers\u201d)  for  meal  preparation,  grocery  and  other  delivery  services.  Riders  and  Eaters  are  collectively  referred  to  as  \u201cend-user(s)\u201d  or\u201cconsumer(s).\u201d Mobility Drivers and Couriers are collectively referred to as \u201cDriver(s).\u201d We also connect consumers with public transportation networks. We usethis same network, technology, operational excellence and product expertise to connect shippers with carriers in the freight industry.Our technology is available in approximately 72 countries around the world, principally in the United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d) and Canada, Latin America, Europe, theMiddle East, Africa, and Asia (excluding China and Southeast Asia).Our SegmentsAs of December 31, 2021, we had three operating and reportable segments: Mobility, Delivery and Freight. Mobility, Delivery and Freight platform offeringseach address large, fragmented markets.MobilityMobility refers to products that connect consumers with Mobility Drivers who provide rides in a variety of vehicles, such as cars, auto rickshaws, motorbikes,minibuses, or taxis. Mobility also includes activity related to our financial partnerships offerings.We believe that our ridesharing category position is a key indicator of our progress towards our massive market opportunity. We calculate our ridesharingcategory position based on the best available data within a given region. For example, in most cases we divide our Mobility Gross Bookings by our estimates oftotal ridesharing Gross Bookings generated by us and other companies with similar ridesharing products. We estimate our total ridesharing Gross Bookings in agiven region by utilizing internal source data, including historical trip, bookings, product mix, and fare information, and external source data provided by publiclyavailable information and marketing analytics firms. Based on these estimates, we believe we have a leading ridesharing category position in every major region ofthe  world  where  we  operate.  We  also  participate  in  certain  regions  through  our  minority-owned  affiliates.  At  the  time  of  entering  into  such  transactions,  webelieved based on our internal estimates using the information then available to us that each of Didi, Grab and Yandex.Taxi, on a pro forma basis, had the leadingridesharing category position in its respective market.DeliveryOur  Delivery  offering  allows  consumers  to  search  for  and  discover  local  restaurants,  order  a  meal,  and  either  pick-up  at  the  restaurant  or  have  the  mealdelivered and, in certain markets, Delivery also includes offerings for grocery, alcohol and convenience store delivery as well as select other goods. We launchedour Delivery app over six years ago. We believe that Delivery not only leverages, but also increases, the supply of Drivers on our network. For example, Deliveryenables Mobility Drivers to increase their utilization and earnings by accessing additional demand for trips during non-peak Mobility times. Delivery also expandsthe pool of Drivers by enabling people who are not Mobility Drivers or who do not have access to Mobility-qualified vehicles to provide delivery services on ourplatform. In addition to benefiting Drivers and consumers, Delivery provides Merchants with an instant mobile presence and efficient delivery capability, which webelieve generates incremental demand and improves margins for Merchants by enabling them to serve more consumers without increasing their existing front-of-house expenses.During 2021, we completed the acquisition of the remaining 45% ownership interest in Cornershop Cayman (\u201cCornershop\u201d) in an all-stock transaction. Theacquisition was accounted for as an equity transaction, as we previously controlled and consolidated Cornershop.

Freight leverages our proprietary technology, brand awareness, and experience revolutionizingindustries to connect carriers with shippers on our platform, and gives carriers upfront, transparent pricing and the ability to book a shipment. The freight industryis highly fragmented  and deeply inefficient.  It can take several  hours, sometimes  days, for shippers to find a truck and driver  for shipments,  with most of theprocess conducted over the phone or by fax. Procurement is highly fragmented, with traditional players relying on local or regional offices to book shipments. It isequally  difficult  for  carriers  to  find  and  book  the  shipments  that  work  for  their  businesses,  spending  hours  on  the  phone  negotiating  pricing  and  terms.  Theseinefficiencies adversely impact both shippers and carriers, and contribute to the number of non-revenue or \u201cdead-head\u201d miles,4", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3527, "end_char_idx": 5900, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "72aaa4e1-6dee-4d3e-98c4-5dc236a80d63": {"__data__": {"id_": "72aaa4e1-6dee-4d3e-98c4-5dc236a80d63", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "/media/mtl/Volume F/PROJECTS/projects/Func_Call/pdf/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2025-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b4bd59b9-7cb8-44ed-b5bc-49d3b0a63141", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "/media/mtl/Volume F/PROJECTS/projects/Func_Call/pdf/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2025-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-28"}, "hash": "c39dab2daa6c227bef1194d83c757a92cc95bbe26249dc4794bd036436bffa14", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e46134de-401e-4648-9945-e4ead2c735b0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "791beb7254aff136eabd8b210169f66ba4c9f28d6071525266779f1b3f50aaea", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "which\n are miles driven by carriers between shipments. Freight greatly reduces friction in the logistics industry by providing an on-demand platform to automateand accelerate logistics transactions end-to-end. Freight connects carriers with shippers available on our platform, and gives carriers upfront, transparent pricingand the ability to book a shipment with the touch of a button.We serve shippers ranging from small- and medium-sized businesses to global enterprises by enabling them to create and tender shipments with a few clicks,secure capacity on demand with upfront pricing, and track those shipments in real-time from pickup to delivery. We believe that all of these factors representsignificant efficiency improvements over traditional freight brokerage providers.During 2021, we completed the acquisition of Tupelo Parent, Inc.

Together, these elements powermovement from point A to point B.Massive NetworkOur massive, efficient, and intelligent network consists of tens of millions of Drivers, consumers, Merchants, shippers and carriers, as well as underlying data, technology, and shared infrastructure. Our network becomes smarter with every trip.In approximately 10,500 cities around the world (as of January 1, 2022), our network powers movement at the touch of abutton for millions, and we hope eventually billions, of people.Leading TechnologyWe  have built proprietary marketplace, routing, and payments technologies. Marketplace technologies are the core of ourdeep  technology  advantage  and  include  demand  prediction,  matching  and  dispatching,  and  pricing  technologies.  Ourtechnologies make it extremely efficient to launch new businesses and operationalize existing ones.Operational ExcellenceOur  regional on-the-ground operations teams use their extensive market-specific knowledge to rapidly launch and scaleproducts in cities, support Drivers, consumers, Merchants, shippers, and carriers, and build and enhance relationships withcities and regulators.Product ExpertiseOur  products are built with the expertise that allows us to set the standard for powering movement on-demand, provideplatform users with a contextual, intuitive interface, continually evolve features and functionality, and deliver safety andtrust.We intend to continue to invest in new platform offerings that we believe will further strengthen our platform and existing offerings.We  believe  that  all  of  these  synergies  serve  the  customer  experience,  enabling  us  to  attract  new  platform  users  and  to  deepen  engagement  with  existingplatform users. Both of these dynamics grow our network scale and liquidity, which further increases the value of our platform to platform users. For example,Delivery attracts new consumers to our network\u2014for the three months ended December 31, 2021, over 60% of first-time Delivery consumers were new to ourplatform.  Additionally,  for  the  three  months  ended  December  31,  2021,  consumers  who  used  both  Mobility  and  Delivery  generated  12.6  Trips  per  month  onaverage, compared  to 5.0 Trips per month on average for consumers who used a single offering  in cities where both Mobility  and Delivery were offered. Webelieve that these trends will improve as we further leverage the power of our platform.With our platform, we are making it even easier for our consumers to unlock convenience. During November 2021, we launched Uber One in the UnitedStates as our single cross-platform membership program that brings together the best of Uber. Uber One members have access to discounts, special pricing, priorityservice, and exclusive perks across our rides, delivery and grocery offerings. Our Uber Pass and Eats Pass membership programs continue to remain available inselect cities as a subscription offering. Our membership programs are designed to make utilizing our suite of products a seamless and rewarding experience for ourconsumers.

Our business is subject to a variety of U.S. federal, state, local and foreign laws, rules,and  regulations,  including  those  related  to  Internet  activities,  privacy,  cybersecurity,  data  protection,  intellectual  property,  competition,  consumer  protection,payments, labor and employment, transportation services, transportation network companies, licensing regulations and taxation. These laws and regulations areconstantly evolving and may be interpreted, applied, created, or amended, in a manner that could harm our business. Examples of certain laws and regulations weare subject to are described below.MobilityOur  platform,  and  in  particular  our  Mobility  products,  are  subject  to  differing,  and  sometimes  conflicting,  laws,  rules,  and  regulations  in  the  numerousjurisdictions  in  which  we  operate.  A  large  number  of  proposals  are  before  various  national,  regional,  and  local  legislative  bodies  and  regulatory  entities,  bothwithin the United States and in foreign jurisdictions, regarding issues related to our business model.In the United States, many state and local laws, rules, and regulations impose legal restrictions and other requirements on operating our Mobility products,including licensing, insurance, screening, and background check requirements. Outside of the United States, certain jurisdictions have adopted similar laws, rules,and  regulations  while  other  jurisdictions  have  not  adopted  any  laws,  rules,  and  regulations  which  govern  our  Mobility  business.  Further,  certain  jurisdictions,including Argentina, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and Spain, six countries that we have identified as expansion markets, have adopted laws, rules, andregulations banning certain ridesharing products or imposing extensive operational restrictions.

These regulations often require TNCs to comply with rules regarding, among other things,background checks, vehicle inspections, accessible vehicles, driver and consumer safety, insurance, driver training, driver conduct, and other similar matters.In addition, many jurisdictions have adopted regulations that apply to how we classify the Drivers who use our platform. For example, California\u2019s AssemblyBill  5  (\u201cAB5\u201d),  which  went  into  effect  in  January  2020,  codified  a  test  to  determine  whether  a  worker  is  an  employee  under  California  law.  The  CaliforniaAttorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint under AB5, alleging that drivers aremisclassified,  and sought  an injunction  and  monetary  damages  related  to  the  alleged  competitive  advantage  caused  by  the  alleged  misclassification  of  drivers.Although the Court issued a preliminary injunction enjoining Uber and Lyft from classifying drivers as independent contractors during the pendency of the lawsuit,the parties were granted a stipulation to dissolve the injunction in April 2021. In November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a California stateballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms like ours for independent work. Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020 and weexpect that Drivers will be able to maintain their status as independent contractors under California law and that we and our competitors will be required to complywith the provisions of Proposition 22.

In March 2021, we returned to Barcelona via a taxi product.\u2022In addition, in August 2018, New York City approved regulations for the local for-hire market (which includes our ridesharing products), including a capon the number of new vehicle licenses issued to drivers who offer for-hire services. In December 2018, New York City also established a standard fortime and distance designed to establish a minimum pay standard for drivers providing for-hire services in New York City, such as those provided byDrivers on our platform.

Ourintellectual property includes the content of our website, mobile applications, registered domain names, software code, firmware, hardware and hardware designs,registered and unregistered trademarks, trademark applications, copyrights, trade secrets, inventions (whether or not patentable), patents, and patent applications.To protect our intellectual property, we rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, patent, and trade secret laws, contractual provisions, end-user policies,and disclosure restrictions. Upon discovery of potential infringement of our intellectual property, we assess and when necessary, take action to protect our rights asappropriate. We also enter into confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants and seek to control access to,and distribution of, our proprietary information in a commercially prudent manner.Research and DevelopmentBecause the industries in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological advances, our ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon ourability  to  ensure  a  continual  and  timely  flow  of  competitive  new  offerings  and  technologies.

We have typically experienced lower quarter-over-quarter growth in Mobility in the first quarter. In 2021, we experienced less seasonality as a result of theCOVID-19  pandemic  and  related  restrictions,  which  altered  typical  travel  patterns.  We  expect  that  seasonality  will  eventually  return  to  its  historic  patterns  asrecovery from the pandemic continues.DeliveryWe typically expect to experience seasonal increases in our revenue in the first and fourth quarters compared to the second and third quarters, although thehistorical growth of Delivery has masked these seasonal fluctuations. In 2021, we experienced less seasonality as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and relatedrestrictions, which accelerated the growth of Delivery in 2021 as cities impose various dining restrictions.Human Capital at UberEmployeesWe  are  a  global  company  and  as  of  December  31,  2021,  we  and  our  subsidiaries  had  approximately  29,300  employees  globally  and  operations  inapproximately  72  countries  and  approximately  10,500  cities  around  the  world.

To attract and retain the best talent, we strive to establish a culture where people of all backgrounds can find a sense of belonging andare able to achieve to their highest capability. We measure how successful we have been in establishing the culture we need through employee engagement surveysand  related  tools.  We  historically  conducted  a  semi-annual  workforce  survey  that  measures  employee  engagement,  overall  satisfaction,  and  well-being.  But  in2021, we made a shift toward continuous listening by launching an employee survey, sent out to a rotating third of employees every month. We use the results ofthese regular checks to better understand employees\u2019 needs and support their teams on topics such as well-being, inclusivity, fairness, rewards and recognition, andgrowth opportunities. For example, our return-to-office plan, which will provide employees with more flexibility to work from home post-pandemic, was createdbased on employee feedback. In addition to the engagement survey results, we also monitor the health of our workforce and the success of our people operationsthrough monitoring metrics such as attrition, retention, and offer acceptance rates, as well as sexual orientation, gender and ethnic diversity.Employee  Development  and  Retention.  We  believe  that  employees  who  have  opportunities  for  development  are  more  engaged,  satisfied,  and  productive.Employees are empowered to drive their own growth, whether by learning on the job, finding stretch assignments, or identifying their next opportunity within Uberthrough internal mobility programs. Employees have access to an internal jobs marketplace for full-time jobs as well as short-term stretch assignments that enablethem to have an impact on other areas of the business. Our goal is to help all employees be their best selves by providing programs and resources that promotewellness  and  productivity.

A diverse set of people choose to use our platform to earn income without having to apply for, or work the fixed schedules associated with,traditional employment. We believe this flexibility is an improvement over traditional work schedules and is something we believe can and should remain availableto anyone who chooses platform-based work. Uber monitors regional and global driver attraction, retention and satisfaction rates.Accessible,  flexible,  independent  work  has  offered  an  option  for  many  workers  historically  marginalized  from  the  labor  market  and  has  enabled  widegeographic coverage and reliable service offerings for consumers. However, it is increasingly clear that more can be done to improve the experience of using anapp to connect with work opportunities. Although the situation varies across countries and cities, the benefits and protections for independent workers are generallypatchy compared with those that employees receive. The current binary system of employment classification under some legal frameworks means that a worker iseither an employee who is provided significant social benefits or an independent worker who has access to relatively few. This does not have to be the case. AtUber, we believe that being your own boss should not have to come at the expense of security and dignity in work. Around the world, Uber has found innovativeways to address these issues.\u2022Advocacy: We have advocated for wider policy solutions to improve access to protections and benefits for independent workers. We believe all workshould be treated equally. We also believe that legislative reform is needed to modernize the social safety net. This includes requiring Uber\u2014and otherapp based companies\u2014to provide benefits and protections to their users without compromising the flexibility of their use of the app. Some examples ofour advocacy to preserve flexibility of work while expanding access to benefits and protections are as follows:\u25e6In  the  United  States,  European  Union,  and  Canada,  we  put  forward  proposals  to  improve  the  quality  of  independent  work,  calling  onpolicymakers, platform companies, and social representatives to work together on a new approach to platform work\u2014one where having accessto protections and benefits doesn\u2019t come at the cost of flexibility and job creation.\u25e6In California, we welcomed  the passage of Proposition 22, which introduced new requirements  for platform companies  like Uber to providebenefits, including healthcare stipends, injury protection insurance, and safety training, and implemented its requirements.\u25e6In the UK, we announced that all UK drivers will be treated as workers and receive additional rights and protections going forward. Pursuant tothis change, drivers who use Uber\u2019s platform in the UK will earn at least the National Living Wage for time spent actively working, be paidholiday pay, and will be enrolled into a pension plan if eligible. We have also announced a partnership with labor union GMB to provide an evenstronger voice to drivers and to raise the standard of flexible work across the industry.\u2022Protections  and benefits:  We  partner  with  leading  insurance  companies  around  the  world  to  pioneer  protections  for  independent  workers,  includingimplementing additional protections and benefits for Drivers in California pursuant to the passage of Proposition 22.\u2022Earnings:  We  are  continually  developing  new  technology  that  Drivers  can  use  to  acquire  information  that  may  help  them  save  on  costs  and  makeinformed choices about where and when to drive (based on when and where their earnings potential is highest).\u2022Progression:  We  have  partnered  with  Arizona  State  University  to  offer  eligible  Drivers  and  their  family  members  access  to  over  100  undergraduatedegree programs, courses in English language learning, or a certificate in entrepreneurship. Through our partnership with Arizona State University, over4,000 Drivers and their family members have enrolled in an undergraduate degree program.\u2022Engagement: We are focused on listening to and responding to the ideas and concerns of Drivers and Merchants who use our platform.

Any  of  the  following  risks  could  have  an  adverse  effect  on  our  business,  financial  condition,operating results, or prospects and could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline, which would cause you to lose all or part of your investment.Our business, financial condition, operating results, or prospects could also be harmed by risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently donot believe are material.Risk Factor SummaryThe following are some of these risks, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition, operating results, or prospects.\u2022The COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of actions to mitigate the pandemic have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect parts of ourbusiness.\u2022Our business would be adversely affected if Drivers were classified as employees, workers or quasi-employees instead of independent contractors.\u2022The  mobility,  delivery,  and  logistics  industries  are  highly  competitive,  with  well-established  and  low-cost  alternatives  that  have  been  available  fordecades, low barriers to entry, low switching costs, and well-capitalized competitors in nearly every major geographic region.\u2022To remain competitive in certain markets, we have in the past lowered, and may continue to lower, fares or service fees, and we have in the past offered,and may continue to offer, significant Driver incentives and consumer discounts and promotions.\u2022We have incurred significant losses since inception, including in the United States and other major markets. We expect our operating expenses to increasesignificantly in the foreseeable future, and we may not achieve or maintain profitability.\u2022If we are unable to attract or maintain a critical mass of Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers, whether as a result of competition or otherfactors, our platform will become less appealing to platform users.\u2022Maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation is critical to our business prospects.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3977, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b8ffe710-421c-4b91-b8b6-ac1d57a2e975": {"__data__": {"id_": "b8ffe710-421c-4b91-b8b6-ac1d57a2e975", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "/media/mtl/Volume F/PROJECTS/projects/Func_Call/pdf/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2025-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8ee22935-67c2-4742-8f6c-c5e0798b4d21", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "/media/mtl/Volume F/PROJECTS/projects/Func_Call/pdf/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2025-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-28"}, "hash": "3c7386dcc3f900ec12ace26023745ab003453f050f4a1ed8cb7adab2eb5e0d91", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ac75eeaa-20f5-416c-a0cf-ff8950e251e6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "/media/mtl/Volume F/PROJECTS/projects/Func_Call/pdf/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2025-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-28"}, "hash": "ea81958efd6198fe701cf30bc4ed859ccf2bf3ca0abd1321bddfa43533736e16", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "We expect our operating expenses to increasesignificantly in the foreseeable future, and we may not achieve or maintain profitability.\u2022If we are unable to attract or maintain a critical mass of Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers, whether as a result of competition or otherfactors, our platform will become less appealing to platform users.\u2022Maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation is critical to our business prospects.

Since then, in an attempt to limit the spread of the virus,various  governments  around  the  world  have  implemented,  lifted,  and  in  some  regions  reinstated  travel  restrictions,  business  restrictions,  school  closures,limitations on social or public gatherings, and other measures that have, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on our business and operations, including, forexample, by reducing the demand for our Mobility offerings globally, and affecting travel behavior and demand. Even as such restrictions are being lifted andmany regions around the world are making progress in their recovery from the pandemic, end-user behavior and demand for our Mobility offering may not recoverto pre-pandemic levels.

In light of the evolving nature of COVID-19 and the uncertainty it has produced around the world, we donot believe it is possible to predict with precision the pandemic\u2019s cumulative and ultimate impact on our future business operations, liquidity, financial condition,and results of operations.

We  areinvolved in numerous legal proceedings globally, including putative class and collective class action lawsuits, demands for arbitration, charges and claims beforeadministrative agencies, and investigations or audits by labor, social security, and tax authorities that claim that Drivers should be treated as our employees (or asworkers  or  quasi-employees  where  those  statuses  exist),  rather  than  as  independent  contractors.  We  believe  that  Drivers  are  independent  contractors  because,among other things, they can choose whether, when, and where to provide services on our platform, are free to provide services on our competitors\u2019 platforms, andprovide a vehicle to perform services on our platform. Nevertheless, we may not be successful in defending the classification of Drivers in some or all jurisdictions.Furthermore, the costs associated with defending, settling, or resolving pending and future lawsuits (including demands for arbitration) relating to the classificationof Drivers have been and may continue to be material to our business.In addition, more than 150,000 Drivers in the United States who have entered into arbitration agreements with us have filed (or13", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 4247, "end_char_idx": 6913, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "911ca289-7497-4c3e-8172-b2eb39251bc1": {"__data__": {"id_": "911ca289-7497-4c3e-8172-b2eb39251bc1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "/media/mtl/Volume F/PROJECTS/projects/Func_Call/pdf/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2025-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d6132698-2cb0-4140-852c-3a3cb523affb", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "/media/mtl/Volume F/PROJECTS/projects/Func_Call/pdf/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2025-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-28"}, "hash": "bb5f4c3d06b165f5cbed79db0a60eae22faa62f6988b48f8e7a14af0929f2a37", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a0f52932-f02a-45b1-89b5-38eac323dfe7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "77a11f22811bfce0020885a078dd11a4cf68a3bd77c910a4e0bbe3b57c4aec08", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "expressed\n an intention to file) arbitration demands against us that assert similar classification claims. We have resolved the classification claims of a majority ofthese Drivers under individual settlement agreements, pursuant to which we have paid approximately $372 million as of December 31, 2021. Furthermore, we areinvolved  in  numerous  legal  proceedings  regarding  the  enforceability  of  arbitration  agreements  entered  into  with  Drivers.  If  we  are  not  successful  in  suchproceedings, this could negatively impact the enforceability of arbitration agreements in other legal proceedings, which could have an adverse consequence on ourbusiness and financial condition.Changes  to  foreign,  state,  and  local  laws  governing  the  definition  or  classification  of  independent  contractors,  or  judicial  decisions  regarding  independentcontractor classification, could require classification of Drivers as employees (or workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist) and/or representation ofDrivers by labor unions. For example, California\u2019s Assembly Bill 5 became effective as of January 1, 2020. Government authorities and private plaintiffs havebrought litigation asserting that Assembly Bill 5 requires Drivers in California to be classified as employees. For example, in May 2020, the California AttorneyGeneral, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint against Uber and Lyft, alleging that drivers aremisclassified, and sought an injunction and monetary damages related to the alleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers. InAugust 2020, the San Francisco Superior Court issued a preliminary injunction enjoining Uber and Lyft from classifying drivers as independent contractors duringthe  pendency  of  the  lawsuit,  and  while  the  California  Court  of  Appeal  subsequently  affirmed  the  lower  court\u2019s  ruling,  on  April  12,  2021,  the  parties  filed  astipulation to dissolve the injunction, which was granted on April 16, 2021.In November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a California state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms likeours for independent  work. Proposition 22 went into  effect  in December  2020 and we expect  that Drivers  will  be able  to maintain  their  status as independentcontractors under California law and that we and our competitors will be required to comply with the provisions of Proposition 22. Although our stipulation todissolve the California Attorney General\u2019s preliminary injunction was granted in April 2021, that litigation remains pending, and we also may face liability relatingto periods before the effective date of Proposition 22. Legal challenges to Proposition 22 have been and may continue to be filed.We face similar challenges in other jurisdictions. For example, in July 2020, the Massachusetts Attorney General filed a complaint against Uber and Lyft,alleging that drivers are misclassified, and seeking an injunction. If we do not prevail in current litigation or similar actions that may be brought in the future, wemay be required to treat Drivers as employees and/or make other changes to our business model in certain jurisdictions. If, as a result of legislation or judicialdecisions,  we  are  required  to  classify  Drivers  as  employees,  we  would  incur  significant  additional  expenses  for  compensating  Drivers,  including  expensesassociated with the application of wage and hour laws (including minimum wage, overtime, and meal and rest period requirements), employee benefits, socialsecurity contributions, taxes (direct and indirect), and potential penalties. In this case, we anticipate significant price increases for Riders to offset these additionalcosts; however, we believe that the financial impact to Uber would be moderated by the likelihood of all competitors raising prices. Additionally, we may not haveadequate Driver supply as Drivers may opt out of our platform given the loss of flexibility under an employment model, and we may not be able to hire a majorityof the Drivers currently using our platform. Further, any such reclassification would require us to fundamentally change our business model, and consequentlyhave an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.Another  example  of  a  recent  judicial  decision  relating  to  Driver  classification  is  the  Aslam,  Farrar,  Hoy  and  Mithu  v.

Subsequent  to the  UK Supreme  Court\u2019s  ruling,  we announced  that  we will  treat  all  UK drivers  as \u201cworkers\u201d  under  UK labor  law, goingforward. Pursuant to this change, Mobility drivers that use our platform will earn at least the National Living Wage for time spent actively working and be paidholiday pay, and eligible drivers will be enrolled into a pension plan. Other examples of judicial decisions include a decision by the French Supreme Court that adriver for a third-party meal delivery service was under a \u201csubordinate relationship\u201d of the service, indicating an employment relationship, a decision by the FrenchSupreme  Court  that  reclassified  an  UberX  Driver  as  an  employee  (which  has  been  followed  by  inconsistent  appellate  decisions  regarding  employee  status),decisions by several Swiss governmental bodies ruling that Drivers should be classified as employees for Swiss social security or regulatory purposes, a recentSpanish regulation of food delivery platforms that presumes employment status and a ruling in September 2021 by a Netherlands court that Mobility Drivers areemployees within the meaning of the taxi collective bargaining agreement.In  addition,  reclassification  of  Drivers  as  employees,  workers  or  quasi-employees  where  those  statuses  exist,  have  and  could  lead  to  groups  of  Driversbecoming represented by labor unions and similar organizations.

If we are unable to compete effectively in theseindustries, our business and financial prospects would be adversely impacted.Our platform provides offerings in the mobility, delivery, and logistics industries. We compete on a global basis, and the markets in which we compete arehighly fragmented. We face significant competition in each of the mobility and delivery industries globally and in the logistics industry in the United States andCanada from existing, well-established, and low-cost alternatives, and in the future we expect to face competition from new market entrants given the low barriersto entry that characterize these industries. In addition, within each of these markets, the cost to switch between products is low. Consumers have a propensity toshift to the lowest-cost or highest-quality provider; Drivers have a propensity to shift to the platform with the highest earnings potential; restaurants and othermerchants have a propensity to shift to the delivery platform that offers the lowest service fee for their meals and other goods and provides the highest volume oforders; and shippers and carriers have a propensity to shift to the platform with the best price and most convenient service for hauling shipments.Further, while we work to expand globally and introduce new products and offerings across a range of industries, many of our competitors remain focused ona limited number of products or on a narrow geographic scope, allowing them to develop specialized expertise and employ resources in a more targeted mannerthan  we  do.  As  we  and  our  competitors  introduce  new  products  and  offerings,  and  as  existing  products  evolve,  we  expect  to  become  subject  to  additionalcompetition. In addition, our competitors may adopt certain of our product features, or may adopt innovations that Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, andcarriers value more highly than ours, which would render our products less attractive or reduce our ability to differentiate  our products. Increased competitioncould result in, among other things, a reduction of the revenue we generate from the use of our platform, the number of platform users, the frequency of use of ourplatform, and our margins.We face competition in each of our offerings, including:\u2022Mobility.  Our  Mobility  offering  competes  with  personal  vehicle  ownership  and  usage,  which  accounts  for  the  majority  of  passenger  miles  in  themarkets that we serve, and traditional transportation services, including taxicab companies and taxi-hailing services, livery and other car services. Inaddition, public transportation can be a superior substitute to our Mobility offering and in many cases, offers a faster and lower-cost travel option inmany cities. We also compete with other ridesharing companies, including certain of our minority-owned affiliates, for Drivers and riders, includingLyft, Ola, Didi, Grab, Bolt, and our Yandex.Taxi joint venture.\u2022Delivery.  Our Delivery  offering  competes  with  numerous  companies  in the  meal,  grocery  and  other  delivery  space  in various  regions  for  Drivers,consumers, and merchants, including DoorDash, Deliveroo, Glovo, Instacart, Gopuff, Rappi, iFood, Delivery Hero, Just Eat Takeaway, and Amazon.Our  Delivery  offering  also  competes  with  restaurants,  including  those  that  offer  their  own  delivery  and/or  take-away,  meal  kit  delivery  services,grocery delivery services, and traditional grocers.\u2022Freight. Our  Freight  offering  competes  with  global  and  North  American  freight  brokers  such  as  C.H.

If we are unable to successfully manage these andsimilar kinds of changes in the future, our business may be adversely impacted.The markets in which we compete have attracted significant investments from a wide range of funding sources, and we anticipate that many of our competitorswill  continue  to  be  highly  capitalized.  Moreover,  certain  of  our  stockholders,  including  SoftBank  (a  large  stockholder),  have  made  substantial  investments  incertain of our competitors and may increase such investments, make new investments in other competitors, or enter into strategic transactions with competitors inthe future.  These investments  or strategic  transactions,  along with other competitive  advantages  discussed above, may allow our competitors  to compete  moreeffectively against us and continue to lower their prices, offer Driver incentives or consumer discounts and promotions, or otherwise attract Drivers, consumers,merchants,  shippers,  and  carriers  to  their  platform  and  away  from  ours.  Such  competitive  pressures  may  lead  us  to  maintain  or  lower  fares  or  service  fees  ormaintain or increase our Driver incentives and consumer discounts and promotions. Ridesharing and certain other categories in which we compete are relativelynascent, and we cannot guarantee that they will stabilize at a competitive equilibrium that will allow us to achieve profitability.We have incurred significant losses since inception, including in the United States and other major markets.

In addition, we sometimes introduce new products that we expect toadd value to our overall platform and network but which we expect will generate lower Gross Bookings per Trip or a lower Take Rate.

Furthermore, if merchants choose to partner with other delivery services in aspecific geographic market, or if merchants choose to engage exclusively with our competitors, other merchant marketing websites, or other delivery services, wemay lack a sufficient variety and supply of restaurant and other merchant options, or lack access to the most popular restaurants, such that our Delivery offeringwill become less appealing to consumers and merchants.

Our Driver qualification and background check process varies by jurisdiction, and there have been allegations, including from regulators, legislators,prosecutors, taxicab owners, and consumers, that our background check process is insufficient or inadequate. With respect to Drivers who are only eligible to makedeliveries  through  Delivery,  our  qualification  and  background  check  standards  are  generally  less  extensive  than  the  standards  for  Drivers  who  are  eligible  toprovide rides through our Mobility products.

Furthermore, if Drivers, merchants, or carriers provide diminished quality ofservice, are involved in incidents regarding safety or privacy, engage in malfeasance, or otherwise violate the law, we may receive unfavorable press coverage andour reputation and business may be harmed. As a result, any of these third parties could take actions that result in harm to our brand, reputation, and consequently,our business.While we have taken significant steps to rehabilitate our brand and reputation, the successful rehabilitation of our brand will depend largely on maintaining agood  reputation,  minimizing  the  number  of  safety  incidents,  continuing  an  improved  culture  and  workplace  practices,  improving  our  compliance  programs,maintaining a high quality of service and ethical behavior, and continuing our marketing and public relations efforts. Our brand promotion, reputation building, andmedia  strategies  have  involved  significant  costs  and  may  not  be  successful.  We  anticipate  that  other  competitors  and  potential  competitors  will  expand  theirofferings, which will make maintaining and enhancing our reputation and brand increasingly more difficult and expensive. If we fail to successfully maintain ourbrand in the current or future competitive environment or if events occur in the future which negatively affect public perception of our company, our brand andreputation would be further damaged and our business may suffer.18", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3861, "end_char_idx": 7078, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "da1ef32e-ae4c-47a3-a7ae-6b612f755cec": {"__data__": {"id_": "da1ef32e-ae4c-47a3-a7ae-6b612f755cec", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "21", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "/media/mtl/Volume F/PROJECTS/projects/Func_Call/pdf/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2025-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8b2c5c91-d533-4501-9340-4bc93e15c99e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "21", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "/media/mtl/Volume F/PROJECTS/projects/Func_Call/pdf/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2025-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-28"}, "hash": "fc61f22b5eb4b4ea4f1d648c237c32344b85d39fe17f316a5443819478767487", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "18c630f1-76b9-43f6-9c6b-e61d0b97b371", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "351288f44f12b4acac9354b820f0f007ba8cf1ee7a6ac8bb004ec443365a018c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Our\n historical  workplace  culture  and  forward-leaning  approach  created  operational,  compliance,  and  cultural  challenges,  and  a  failure  to  address  thesechallenges would adversely impact our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.Our historical workplace culture and forward-leaning approach created significant operational and cultural challenges that have in the past harmed, and may inthe  future  continue  to  harm,  our  business  results  and  financial  condition.  Our  prior  failure  to  prioritize  compliance,  has  led  to  increased  regulatory  scrutinyglobally. Although we have since made changes in our company\u2019s cultural values and composition of our leadership team and have an ongoing commitment topromote  transparency  and  collaboration,  regulators  may  continue  to  perceive  us  negatively,  which  would  adversely  impact  our  business,  financial  condition,operating results, and prospects.Our historical workplace culture also created a lack of transparency internally, which resulted in siloed teams that lacked coordination and knowledge sharing,causing misalignment and inefficiencies in operational and strategic objectives. Although we have since embraced a culture of enhanced transparency, these effortsmay not be successful. Furthermore, many of our regional operations are not centrally managed, such that key policies may not be adequately communicated ormanaged to achieve consistent business objectives across functions and regions. Although we have reorganized some of our teams to address such issues, suchreorganizations may not be successful in aligning operational or strategic objectives across our company.Our workforce and operations have grown substantially since our inception and we have implemented several reductions in workforce in 2019 and 2020. If weare unable to optimize our organizational structure or effectively manage our growth or any reductions in workforce, our financial performance and futureprospects will be adversely affected.Since our inception, we have experienced rapid growth in the United States and internationally. This expansion increases the complexity of our business andhas  placed,  and  will  continue  to  place,  significant  strain  on  our  management,  personnel,  operations,  systems,  technical  performance,  financial  resources,  andinternal financial control and reporting functions.

We expect the total number of our employees located outside theUnited States to increase as we expand globally. Properly managing our growth will require us to continue to hire, train, and manage qualified employees and staff,including engineers, operations personnel, financial and accounting staff, and sales and marketing staff, and to improve and maintain our technology. If our newhires perform poorly, if we are unsuccessful in hiring, training, managing, and integrating new employees and staff, or if we are not successful in retaining ourexisting employees and staff, our business may be harmed. Moreover, in order to optimize our organizational structure, we have implemented several reductions inworkforce and restructurings, including in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our business, and may in the future implement other reductionsin  workforce.  Any  reduction  in  workforce  or  restructuring  may  yield  unintended  consequences  and  costs,  such  as  attrition  beyond  the  intended  reduction  inworkforce, the distraction of employees, or reduced employee morale and could adversely affect our reputation as an employer, which could make it more difficultfor  us  to  hire  new  employees  in  the  future  and  increase  the  risk  that  we  may  not  achieve  the  anticipated  benefits  from  the  reduction  in  workforce.

Additionally, in October 2021, we acquired The Drizly Group, Inc.,which operates an on-demand alcohol marketplace in North America, in order to further expand our Delivery offering to alcohol.

These fluctuations may be a result of a variety offactors, some of which are beyond our control, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we experience seasonal fluctuations in our financial results.For Mobility, we typically generate higher revenue in our fourth quarter compared to other quarters due in part to fourth quarter holiday and business demand, andtypically generate lower revenue in our third quarter compared to other quarters due in part to less usage of our platform during peak vacation season in certaincities, such as Paris. We have typically experienced lower quarter-over-quarter growth in Mobility in the first quarter. In 2021, we experienced less seasonality as aresult of the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions, which altered typical travel patterns. For Delivery, we expect to experience seasonal increases in ourrevenue  in  the  first  and  fourth  quarters  compared  to  the  second  and  third  quarters,  although  the  historical  growth  of  Delivery  has  masked  these  seasonalfluctuations; however, in 2021, we experienced less seasonality as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions, which accelerated the growth ofDelivery in 2021 as cities imposed dining restrictions and shelter in place orders. Our growth has made, and may in the future make, seasonal fluctuations difficultto  detect.  We  expect  these  seasonal  trends  to  become  more  pronounced  over  time  as  our  growth  slows.  Other  seasonal  trends  may  develop  or  these  existingseasonal trends may become more extreme, which would contribute to fluctuations in our operating results. In addition to seasonality, our operating results mayfluctuate as a result of factors including our ability to attract and retain new platform users, increased competition in the markets in which we operate, our ability toexpand our operations in new and existing markets, our ability to maintain an adequate growth rate and effectively manage that growth, our ability to keep pacewith  technological  changes  in  the  industries  in  which  we  operate,  changes  in  governmental  or  other  regulations  affecting  our  business,  harm  to  our  brand  orreputation, and other risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As such, we may not accurately forecast our operating results. We base ourexpense levels and investment plans on estimates, which has become more challenging in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. A significant portion of our expensesand investments are fixed, and we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our revenue is less than expected, resulting in losses that exceed ourexpectations.

We experience strong competition in large metropolitan areas, which has led us to offer significant Driver incentivesand  consumer  discounts  and  promotions  in  these  large  metropolitan  areas.

Outbreaks  of  contagiousdiseases or other viruses, such as COVID-19, could lead to a sustained decline in the desirability of living, working and congregating in metropolitan areas inwhich we operate. Any short-term or long-term shifts in the travel patterns of consumers away from metropolitan areas, due to health concerns regarding epidemicsor pandemics such as COVID-19, could have an adverse impact on our Mobility Gross Bookings from these areas. An economic downturn, increased competition,or regulatory obstacles in any of these key metropolitan areas would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results to a much greaterdegree than would the occurrence of such events in other areas. In addition, any changes to local laws or regulations within these key metropolitan areas that affectour ability to operate or increase our operating expenses in these markets would have an adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, if we are unable to renewexisting  licenses  or  do  not  receive  new  licenses  in  key  metropolitan  areas  where  we  operate  or  such  licenses  are  terminated,  any  inability  to  operate  in  suchmetropolitan area, as well as the publicity concerning any such termination or non-renewal, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operatingresults.In addition, in August 2018, New York City approved regulations for the local for-hire market (which includes our ridesharing products), including a cap onthe  number  of  new  vehicle  licenses  issued  to  drivers  who  offer  for-hire  services.  In  December  2018,  New  York  City  implemented  a  per-mile  and  per-minuteminimum trip payment formula, designed to establish a minimum pay standard, for drivers providing for-hire services in New York City, such as those provided byDrivers on our platform. These minimum rates took effect in February 2019. Since implementation, these regulations have had an adverse impact on our financialperformance in New York City and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, in November 2019, a ballot measure to impose a surcharge on ridesharingtrips in San Francisco was approved by voters in San Francisco. This surcharge took effect on January 1, 2020. In addition, other jurisdictions such as Seattle havepassed, or may consider or pass regulations that would implement minimum wage requirements or permit drivers to negotiate for minimum wages while providingservices on our platform. Further, we expect that we will continue to face challenges in penetrating lower-density suburban and rural areas, where our network issmaller and less liquid, the cost of personal vehicle ownership is lower, and personal vehicle ownership is more convenient. If we are not successful in penetratingsuburban  and  rural  areas,  or  if  we  are  unable  to  operate  in  certain  key  metropolitan  areas  in  the  future,  our  ability  to  serve  what  we  consider  to  be  our  totaladdressable market would be limited, and our business, financial condition, and operating results would suffer.In 2021, we generated 11% of our Mobility Gross Bookings from trips that either started or were completed at an airport.

As a result of this concentration, ouroperating results are susceptible to existing regulations and regulatory changes that impact the ability of drivers using our platform to provide trips to and fromairports. In addition, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, travel behavior has changed and airline travel has slowed, reducing the demand for Mobility to andfrom airports. Sustained declines in air travel  due to COVID-19, or other travel-related  health concerns,  could continue to suppress demand for airport-relatedMobility  and  reduce  our  Mobility  Gross  Bookings  from  airport  trips.  Certain  airports  currently  regulate  ridesharing  within  airport  boundaries,  including  bymandating  that  ridesharing  service  providers  obtain  airport-specific  licenses,  and  some  airports,  particularly  those  outside  the  United  States,  have  bannedridesharing operations altogether. Despite such bans, some Drivers continue to provide Mobility services, including trips to and from airports, despite lacking therequisite permits. Such actions may result in the imposition of fines or sanctions, including further bans on our ability to operate within airport boundaries, againstus or Drivers. Additional bans on our airport operations, or any permitting requirements or instances of non-compliance by Drivers, would significantly disrupt ouroperations.  In  addition,  if  drop-offs  or  pick-ups  of  riders  become  inconvenient  because  of  airport  rules  or  regulations,  or  more  expensive  because  of  airport-imposed fees, the number of Drivers or consumers could decrease, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. While wehave entered into agreements with most major U.S. airports as well as certain airports outside the United States to allow the use of our platform within airportboundaries, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to renew such agreements on favorable terms if at all, and we may not be successful in negotiating similaragreements with airports in all jurisdictions.If  we  fail  to  offer  autonomous  vehicle  technologies  on  our  platform  or  fail  to  offer  such  technologies  on  our  platform  before  our  competitors,  or  if  suchtechnologies fail to perform as expected, are inferior to those offered by our competitors, or are perceived as less safe than those offered by competitors or non-autonomous vehicles, our financial performance and prospects would be adversely impacted.We have invested, and we may continue to invest, substantial amounts in companies with whom we partner to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on ourplatform. For example, in January 2021, we completed the merger of our autonomous technologies business with Aurora, and included a $400 million investmentin the combined company and a commercial agreement pursuant to which we and Aurora will collaborate with respect to the launch and commercialization of self-driving vehicles on our ridesharing24", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3724, "end_char_idx": 7179, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a1b61903-7053-4bd5-9972-ffa099bc6cf8": {"__data__": {"id_": "a1b61903-7053-4bd5-9972-ffa099bc6cf8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "27", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "/media/mtl/Volume F/PROJECTS/projects/Func_Call/pdf/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2025-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a0afc7e2-611e-47df-9d3d-bad2597d4cbb", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "27", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "/media/mtl/Volume F/PROJECTS/projects/Func_Call/pdf/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2025-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-28"}, "hash": "85c1481ef0f532f97e45d100d1b7945cd77a024613b797fb1c14ac95b3bdf61b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "7652bb01-3857-4987-9b61-afcaf7acc642", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1604ca355e31e7b124c30dc522ffad734fc021bae4a03b97e9b820b7c062953b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "network.\n We believe that autonomous vehicle technologies may have the ability to meaningfully impact the industries in which we compete and that autonomousvehicles present substantial opportunities. Several companies other than Aurora, including Waymo, Cruise Automation, Tesla, Apple, Zoox (which Amazon hasacquired), Aptiv, and Nuro, are developing autonomous vehicle technologies, either alone or through collaborations with car manufacturers, and we expect thatthey  will  use  such  technology  to  further  compete  with  us  in  the  mobility,  delivery,  or  logistics  industries.  Waymo  has  already  introduced  a  commercializedridehailing fleet of autonomous vehicles, and it is possible that our competitors could introduce autonomous vehicle offerings earlier than we will be able to offerautonomous  vehicles  on  our  platform  through  our  commercial  agreement  with  Aurora  or  other  partners.  In  the  event  that  our  competitors  bring  autonomousvehicles to market before we are able to offer autonomous vehicles on our platform, or their technology is or is perceived to be superior to the technology of partieswith which we partner to offer autonomous vehicles on our platform, they may be able to leverage such technology to compete more effectively with us, whichwould adversely impact our financial performance and our prospects. For example, use of autonomous vehicles could substantially reduce the cost of providingridesharing, delivery, or logistics services, which could allow competitors to offer such services at a substantially lower price as compared to the price available toconsumers on our platform. If a significant  number of consumers choose to use our competitors\u2019 offerings over ours, our financial  performance and prospectswould be adversely impacted.Autonomous vehicle technologies involve significant risks and liabilities. Collisions, including fatal collisions, have happened. Failures of autonomous vehicletechnologies that we may offer on our platform or crashes involving autonomous vehicles using the technology of our partners, could generate substantial liabilityfor us, create negative publicity about us, or result in regulatory scrutiny, all of which would have an adverse effect on our reputation, brand, business, prospects,and operating results.Federal and state government regulations specifically designed to govern autonomous vehicle operation, testing and/or manufacture are developing. Theseregulations could include requirements that delay or limit our ability to offer autonomous vehicles on our platform. If regulations of this nature are implemented,we may not be able to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on our platform in the manner we expect, or at all. Further, if we or parties with which we partner tooffer autonomous vehicle technologies are unable to comply with existing or new regulations or laws applicable to autonomous vehicles, we and our partners couldbecome subject to substantial fines or penalties.Our business depends on retaining and attracting high-quality personnel, and continued attrition, future attrition, or unsuccessful succession planning couldadversely affect our business.Our success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain high-quality management, operations, engineering, and other personnel who are in highdemand, are often subject to competing employment offers, and are attractive recruiting targets for our competitors. Challenges related to our historical culture andworkplace practices and negative publicity we experience have in the past led to significant attrition and made it more difficult to attract high-quality employees.Our employees have been working from home for almost two years in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, and although we announced our \u201creturn to office\u201d plan,which includes shifting to a hybrid model where employees have flexibility to work from home, we have not yet set a return-to-office-date in light of the dynamicnature of the pandemic.

Some of the factors that have an impact ondiscretionary consumer spending include general economic conditions, unemployment, consumer debt, reductions in net worth, residential real estate and mortgagemarkets,  taxation,  energy  prices,  interest  rates,  consumer  confidence,  and  other  macroeconomic  factors.  Consumer  preferences  tend  to  shift  to  lower-costalternatives during recessionary periods and other periods in which disposable income is adversely affected. In such circumstances, consumers may choose to useone of our lower price-point products over a higher Gross Bookings per Trip offering, may choose to forgo our offerings for lower-cost personal vehicle or publictransportation alternatives, or may reduce total miles traveled as economic activity decreases. Such a shift in consumer behavior may reduce our network liquidityand may harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. Likewise, small businesses that do not have substantial resources, including many of themerchants in our network, tend to be more adversely affected by poor economic conditions than large businesses. Further, because spending for food purchasesfrom merchants is generally considered discretionary, any decline in consumer spending may have a disproportionate effect on our Delivery offering. If spending atmany of the merchants in our network declines, or if a significant number of these merchants go out of business, consumers may be less likely to use our productsand offerings, which could harm our business and operating results. Alternatively, if economic conditions improve, it could lead to Drivers obtaining additional oralternative opportunities for work, which could negatively impact the number of Drivers on our platform, and thereby reduce our network liquidity.Increases in fuel, food, labor, energy, and other costs due to inflation and other factors could adversely affect our operating results.Factors  such  as  inflation,  increased  fuel  prices,  and  increased  vehicle  purchase,  rental,  or  maintenance  costs,  including  increased  prices  of  new  and  usedvehicle parts as a result of recent global supply chain challenges, may increase the costs incurred by Drivers and carriers when providing services on our platform.Similarly,  factors  such  as  inflation,  increased  food  costs,  increased  labor  and  employee  benefit  costs,  increased  rental  costs,  and  increased  energy  costs  mayincrease merchant operating costs, particularly in certain international markets, such as Egypt. Many of the factors affecting Driver, merchant, and carrier costs arebeyond the control of these parties. In many cases, these increased costs may cause Drivers and carriers to spend less time providing services on our platform or toseek alternative sources of income. Likewise, these increased costs may cause merchants to pass costs on to consumers by increasing prices, which would likelycause order volume to decline, may cause merchants to cease operations altogether, or may cause carriers to pass costs on to shippers, which may cause shipmentson our  platform  to  decline.  A  decreased  supply  of Drivers,  consumers,  merchants,  shippers,  or carriers  on our  platform  would  decrease  our  network  liquidity,which could harm our business and operating results.If we experience security or privacy breaches or other unauthorized or improper access to, use of, disclosure of, alteration of or destruction of our proprietaryor confidential data, employee data, or platform user data, we may face loss of revenue, harm to our brand, business disruption, and significant liabilities.We collect, use, and process a variety of personal data, such as email addresses, mobile phone numbers, profile photos, location information, drivers\u2019 licensenumbers and Social Security numbers of Drivers, consumer payment card information, and Driver and merchant bank account information.

If Careem becomes subject to liability as a result of this or other datasecurity  breaches,  or  if  we  fail  to  remediate  this  or  any  other  data  security  breach  that  Careem  or  we  experience,  we  may  face  harm  to  our  brand,  businessdisruption, and significant liabilities.If we are unable to successfully introduce new or upgraded products, offerings, or features for Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers, we mayfail to retain and attract such users to our platform and our operating results would be adversely affected.To continue to retain and attract Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers to our platform, we will need to continue to invest in the developmentof new products, offerings, and features that add value for Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers and that differentiate us from our competitors. Forexample, in January 2020, we introduced a number of product changes in California intended to, among other things, provide Drivers with more information aboutrider destinations, trip distance, and expected fares, display prices more clearly, and allow users to select preferred Drivers, all of which are intended to furtherstrengthen the independence of Drivers in California and protect their ability to work flexibly when using the Uber platform.Developing and delivering these new or upgraded products, offerings, and features is costly, and the success of such new products, offerings, and featuresdepends on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction, and market acceptance of such products, offerings, and features.

If we do not successfully manage those concerns, we could become subject to adverse regulatory actions and suffer reputational harm or otheradverse financial and accounting consequences.In certain jurisdictions, including India, Brazil, and Mexico, as well as certain other countries in Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, we allowconsumers to use cash to pay Drivers the entire fare of rides and cost of meal deliveries (including our service fee from such rides and meal or grocery deliveries).In 2021, cash-paid trips accounted for approximately 7% of our global27", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3476, "end_char_idx": 7144, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a59a7372-f490-4913-804b-ee1086c3a567": {"__data__": {"id_": "a59a7372-f490-4913-804b-ee1086c3a567", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "30", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "/media/mtl/Volume F/PROJECTS/projects/Func_Call/pdf/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2025-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c21f9434-1b33-4802-ac11-0aa2f017d2dd", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "30", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "/media/mtl/Volume F/PROJECTS/projects/Func_Call/pdf/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2025-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-28"}, "hash": "323839137664675a3d3f6c324ffe8e469eb40e1a5517cdc293d111bfc7ad639e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "2dc01648-aa69-469c-bb2c-690016f67350", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "745db2d7246d104c23dffc05b95f5a36561812db6c93fedadc07ce7d57cb11b1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Gross\n Bookings.  This  percentage  may  increase  in  the  future,  particularly  in  the  markets  in  which  Careem  operates.  The  use  of  cash  in  connection  with  ourtechnology raises numerous regulatory, operational, and safety concerns. For example, many jurisdictions have specific regulations regarding the use of cash forridesharing and certain jurisdictions prohibit the use of cash for ridesharing. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in the imposition of significantfines and penalties and could result in a regulator requiring that we suspend operations in those jurisdictions. In addition to these regulatory concerns, the use ofcash with our Mobility products and Delivery offering can increase safety and security risks for Drivers and riders, including potential robbery, assault, violent orfatal attacks, and other criminal acts. In certain jurisdictions such as Brazil, serious safety incidents resulting in robberies and violent, fatal attacks on Drivers whileusing our platform have been reported. If we are not able to adequately address any of these concerns, we could suffer significant reputational harm, which couldadversely impact our business.In addition, establishing the proper infrastructure to ensure that we receive the correct service fee on cash trips is complex, and has in the past meant and maycontinue to mean that we cannot collect the entire service fee for certain of our cash-based trips. We have created systems for Drivers to collect and deposit thecash received for cash-based trips and deliveries, as well as systems for us to collect, deposit, and properly account for the cash received, some of which are notalways effective, convenient, or widely-adopted by Drivers. Creating, maintaining, and improving these systems requires significant effort and resources, and wecannot guarantee these systems will be effective in collecting amounts due to us. Further, operating a business that uses cash raises compliance risks with respect toa variety of rules and regulations, including anti-money laundering laws. If Drivers fail to pay us under the terms of our agreements or if our collection systemsfail, we may be adversely affected by both the inability to collect amounts due and the cost of enforcing the terms of our contracts, including litigation. Suchcollection failure and enforcement costs, along with any costs associated with a failure to comply with applicable rules and regulations, could, in the aggregate,impact our financial performance.Loss or material modification of our credit card acceptance privileges could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.In 2021, 74% of our Gross Bookings were paid by either credit card or debit card. As such, the loss of our credit card acceptance privileges would significantlylimit our business model. We are required by our payment processors to comply with payment card network operating rules, including the Payment Card Industry(\u201cPCI\u201d) and Data Security Standard (the \u201cStandard\u201d). The Standard is a comprehensive set of requirements for enhancing payment account data security developedby the PCI Security Standards Council to help facilitate the broad adoption of consistent data security measures. Our failure to comply with the Standard and othernetwork operating  rules could result  in fines or restrictions  on our ability  to accept payment  cards. Under certain circumstances  specified in the payment cardnetwork rules, we may be required to submit to periodic audits, self-assessments, or other assessments of our compliance with the Standard. Such activities mayreveal  that  we  have  failed  to  comply  with  the  Standard.  If  an  audit,  self-  assessment,  or  other  test  determines  that  we  need  to  take  steps  to  remediate  anydeficiencies, such remediation efforts may distract our management team and require us to undertake costly and time consuming remediation efforts. In addition,even if we comply with the Standard, there is no assurance that we will be protected from a security breach. Moreover, the payment card networks could adopt newoperating  rules  or  interpret  existing  rules  that  we  or  our  processors  might  find  difficult  or  even  impossible  to  follow,  or  costly  to  implement.  In  addition  toviolations of network rules, including the Standard, any failure to maintain good relationships with the payment card networks could impact our ability to receiveincentives  from  them,  could  increase  our  costs,  or  could  otherwise  harm  our  business.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4567, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2dc01648-aa69-469c-bb2c-690016f67350": {"__data__": {"id_": "2dc01648-aa69-469c-bb2c-690016f67350", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "30", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "/media/mtl/Volume F/PROJECTS/projects/Func_Call/pdf/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2025-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c21f9434-1b33-4802-ac11-0aa2f017d2dd", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "30", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "/media/mtl/Volume F/PROJECTS/projects/Func_Call/pdf/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2025-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-28"}, "hash": "323839137664675a3d3f6c324ffe8e469eb40e1a5517cdc293d111bfc7ad639e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a59a7372-f490-4913-804b-ee1086c3a567", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "30", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "/media/mtl/Volume F/PROJECTS/projects/Func_Call/pdf/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2025-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-28"}, "hash": "913bbd5838f9f1ddf874ae0a8b7fbf8a74df135646a0f8f5bdb18ded9c80104a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "In addition,even if we comply with the Standard, there is no assurance that we will be protected from a security breach.

While we employ practices designedto monitor our compliance with the licenses of third-party open source software and protect our valuable proprietary source code, we have not run a complete opensource license review and may inadvertently use third-party open source software in a manner that exposes us to claims of non-compliance with the applicableterms of such license, including claims for infringement of intellectual property rights or for breach of contract. Furthermore, there is an increasing number ofopen-source  software  license  types,  almost  none  of  which  have  been  tested  in  a  court  of  law,  resulting  in  a  dearth  of  guidance  regarding  the  proper  legalinterpretation of such licenses. If we were to receive a claim of non-compliance with the terms of any of our open source licenses, we may be required to publiclyrelease certain portions of our proprietary source code or expend substantial time and resources to re-engineer some or all of our software.In addition, the use of third-party open source software typically exposes us to greater risks than the use of third-party commercial software because open-source  licensors  generally  do  not  provide  warranties  or  controls  on  the  functionality  or  origin  of  the  software.  Use  of  open  source  software  may  also  presentadditional security risks because the public availability of such software may make it easier for hackers and other third parties to determine how to compromise ourplatform.

Furthermore, our futureincome taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated injurisdictions  that  have  higher  statutory  tax  rates,  changes  in  the  valuation  allowance  on  our  U.S.  and  Netherlands'  deferred  tax  assets,  or  changes  in  tax  laws,regulations, or accounting principles.

Any adverse outcome of such reviews and audits could have an adverse effect on our financialposition and operating results. In addition, the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment byour management, and we have engaged in many transactions for which the ultimate tax determination remains uncertain. The ultimate tax outcome may differ fromthe amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made.

Any subsequent integration or continued operation of such acquired businesses may result in an increased effective tax rate in certainjurisdictions or potential indirect tax costs, which could result in us incurring additional tax liabilities or having to establish a reserve in our consolidated financialstatements, and could adversely affect our financial results.Changes in global and U.S. tax legislation may adversely affect our financial condition, operating results, and cash flows.We are a U.S.-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. U.S. tax legislation enacted in 2017, and modified in2020, has significantly changed the U.S. federal income taxation of U.S. corporations.

Inaddition, it remains unclear in some instances how these U.S. federal income tax changes will affect state and local taxation, which often uses federal taxableincome as a starting point for computing state and local tax liabilities.We are unable to predict what global or U.S. tax reforms may be proposed or enacted in the future or what effects such future changes would have on ourbusiness. Any such changes in tax legislation, regulations, policies or practices in the jurisdictions in which we operate could increase the estimated tax liabilitythat we have expensed to date and paid or accrued on our balance sheet; affect our financial position, future operating results, cash flows, and effective tax rateswhere we have operations; reduce post-tax returns to our stockholders; and increase the complexity, burden, and cost of tax compliance.

As such, even if we are able to identify atarget  for  acquisition,  we  may  not  be  able  to  complete  the  acquisition  on  commercially  reasonable  terms,  we  may  not  be  able  to  receive  approval  from  theapplicable competition authorities, or such target may be acquired by another company, including one of our competitors.Further, negotiations for potential acquisitions or other transactions may result in the diversion of our management\u2019s time and significant out-of-pocket costs.We  may  expend  significant  cash  or  incur  substantial  debt  to  finance  such  acquisitions,  and  such  indebtedness  may  restrict  our  business  or  require  the  use  ofavailable  cash  to  make  interest  and  principal  payments.  In  addition,  we  may  finance  or  otherwise  complete  acquisitions  by  issuing  equity  or  convertible  debtsecurities, which may result in dilution to our stockholders, or if such convertible debt securities are not converted, significant cash outlays. If we fail to evaluateand  execute  acquisitions  or  other  strategic  transactions  successfully  or  fail  to  successfully  address  any  of  these  risks,  our  business,  financial  condition,  andoperating results may be harmed.In  addition,  any  businesses  we  acquire  may  not  perform  as  well  as  we  expect.  Failure  to  manage  and  successfully  integrate  acquired  businesses  andtechnologies, including managing internal controls and any privacy or data security risks associated with such acquisitions, may harm our operating results andexpansion prospects. For example, Careem has historically shared certain user data with certain government authorities, which conflicts with our global policiesregarding data use, sharing, and ownership. We have maintained our data use, sharing, and ownership practices for both our business and Careem\u2019s business, anddoing  so  may  cause  our  relationships  with  government  authorities  in  certain  jurisdictions  to  suffer,  and  may  result  in  such  government  authorities  assessingsignificant fines or penalties against us or shutting down our or Careem\u2019s app on either a temporary or indefinite basis.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4078, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f0ad19f3-4e96-42da-bf93-fb00984b58fd": {"__data__": {"id_": "f0ad19f3-4e96-42da-bf93-fb00984b58fd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "36", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "/media/mtl/Volume F/PROJECTS/projects/Func_Call/pdf/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2025-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "907c4aad-a173-4439-9c21-7a9214383daf", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "36", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "/media/mtl/Volume F/PROJECTS/projects/Func_Call/pdf/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2025-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-28"}, "hash": "1ccd82c2a722c289321b65cbde20707cc466150b8eeeeee0bd9b0d0c97dd1c17", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ef7b0898-0c97-4b3c-8ec9-b87958362913", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "36", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "/media/mtl/Volume F/PROJECTS/projects/Func_Call/pdf/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2025-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-28"}, "hash": "b8549564f41ed69b21c2d607758f49d818e0b2f7c0fbf088277c5d1a5f889a2c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Failure  to  manage  and  successfully  integrate  acquired  businesses  andtechnologies, including managing internal controls and any privacy or data security risks associated with such acquisitions, may harm our operating results andexpansion prospects.

Such structures may delay the efficiencies that we expect to gain from the acquisitionand our brand and reputation could be impacted by any damage or reputational harm to the acquired company\u2019s brand.In  addition,  our  acquisition  of  Careem  has  increased  our  risks  under  the  U.S. Foreign  Corrupt  Practices  Act  (\u201cFCPA\u201d)  and  other  similar  laws  outside  theUnited States.

In some cases, we have applied for and obtained licenses or permits to operate and must continue to comply with the license or permit requirementsor risk revocation. In addition, we may not be able to maintain or renew any such license or permit. For example, TfL scrutinizes our business in London on an on-going basis and we are subject to license reviews at renewal. In November 2019, TfL declined to issue us a license, finding that we were not \u201cfit and proper,\u201dincluding with respect to confidence in our change and release management processes. We successfully appealed and in September 2020, Westminster MagistratesCourt granted us an 18 month operating license on largely the same conditions as our previous license, finding us a fit and proper person. Two new conditions(which we volunteered) include providing to TfL consolidated monthly reporting in relation to regulatory obligations and maintaining our current processes. Anyinability  to  operate  in  markets  such  as  London,  as  well  as  publicity  concerning  adverse  judicial  or  licensing  decisions,  would  adversely  affect  our  business,revenue,  and  operating  results.  We  cannot  predict  whether  future  regulatory  decisions  or  legislation  in  other  jurisdictions  may  embolden  or  encourage  otherauthorities to take similar actions even where we are operating according to the terms of an existing license or permit.

Except for the vehicle inspection,we have an injunction against such operational requirements which, if implemented without modification, could have a negative impact on our business and ourfailure to comply with such regulations may result in a potential revocation of our license to operate in Mexico City.Traditional taxicab and car service operators in various jurisdictions continue to lobby legislators and regulators to block our Mobility products or to require usto comply with regulatory, insurance, record-keeping, licensing, and other requirements to which taxicab and car services are subject. For example, in January2019, we suspended our Mobility products in Barcelona after the regional government enacted regulations mandating minimum wait times before riders could bepicked up by ridesharing drivers; in March 2021, we returned to Barcelona via taxis only. In December 2018, New York City\u2019s Taxi and Limousine Commissionimplemented a per-mile and per-minute minimum trip payment formula, designed to establish a minimum pay standard, for drivers providing for-hire services inNew York City, such as those provided by Drivers on our platform. These minimum rates took effect in February 2019. Since implementation, these regulationshave had an adverse impact on our financial performance in New York City and may continue to do so in the future. In August 2018, the New York City Councilvoted to approve various measures to further regulate our business, including driver earning rules, licensing requirements, and a one-year freeze on new for-hirevehicle licenses for ridesharing services like those enabled via our platform, while the city studies whether a permanent freeze would help reduce congestion. InAugust 2019, New York City\u2019s Taxi and Limousine Commission voted to extend such freeze on for-hire vehicle licenses and also voted to enact a new \u201ccruisingcap,\u201d intended to reduce the number of for-hire vehicles operating without passengers on platforms like ours in the central business district of New York City.Although such \u201ccruising cap\u201d was struck down by a New York state judge in December 2019, the freeze on for-hire vehicle licenses remains. Additionally, inNovember 2019, a ballot measure to impose a surcharge on ridesharing trips in San Francisco was passed by voters in San Francisco and such surcharge took effecton January 1, 2020. Also in January 2020, a new tax went into effect in Chicago that imposes a surcharge of up to $3 per ridesharing trip taken in Chicago. Inaddition, in October 2020, the Seattle City Council passed a minimum pay standard for drivers providing services on our platform that went into effect on January1, 2021, and other jurisdictions have in the past considered or may consider regulations which would implement minimum wage requirements or permit drivers tonegotiate for minimum wages while providing services on our platform. Similar legislative or regulatory initiatives are being considered or have been enacted incountries outside the United States.

In such jurisdictions, we may be subject to regulatory fines and proceedings and, in certain cases, may be required to ceaseoperations altogether if we continue to operate our business as currently conducted, unless and until such laws and regulations are reformed to clarify that ourbusiness operations are fully compliant. For example, in September 2020, the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal issued a ruling against a group of drivers whoused the Uber app, concluding that by driving for hire without a Hire Car Permit, they violated the local Road Traffic Ordinance. We are considering further legalchallenges and possible policy solutions. However, these developments may adversely affect our ability to offer ridesharing services and negatively impact ourfinancial performance in Hong Kong. As another example, in January 2020, we ceased offering our Mobility products in Colombia after a Colombian court ruledthat  we  violated  local  competition  laws.  In  response,  we  appealed  the  decision,  made  certain  changes  to  our  Mobility  products  in  Colombia  and  re-launchedMobility in Colombia in February 2020, and in June 2020, the Appeals Court of Bogota revoked its order to block Mobility products in Colombia. Furthermore, incertain of these jurisdictions, we continue to provide our products and offerings while we assess the applicability of these laws and regulations to our products andofferings or while we seek regulatory or policy changes to address concerns with respect to our ability to comply with these laws and regulations. Our decision tocontinue operating in these instances has come under investigation or has otherwise been subject to scrutiny by government authorities. Our continuation of thispractice and other past practices may result in fines or other penalties against us and Drivers imposed by local regulators, potentially increasing the risk that ourlicenses or permits that are necessary to operate in such jurisdictions will not be renewed. Such fines and penalties have in the past been, and may in the futurecontinue to be, imposed solely on Drivers, which may cause Drivers to stop providing services on our platform. In many instances, we make the business decisionas  a  gesture  of  goodwill  to  pay  the  fines  on  behalf  of  Drivers  or  to  pay  Drivers\u2019  defense  costs,  which,  in  the  aggregate,  can  be  in  the  millions  of  dollars.Furthermore, such business practices may also result in negative press coverage, which may discourage Drivers and consumers from using our platform and couldadversely affect our revenue. In addition, we face regulatory obstacles, including those lobbied for by our competitors or from local governments globally, thathave favored and may continue to favor local or incumbent competitors, including obstacles for potential Drivers seeking to obtain required licenses or vehiclecertifications. In addition, an increasing number of municipalities have proposed delivery network fee caps with respect to our Delivery offering and caps on surgepricing with respect to our Mobility offering. We have incurred, and expect that we will continue to incur, significant costs in defending our right to operate inaccordance with our business model in many jurisdictions. To the extent that efforts to block or limit our operations are successful, or we or Drivers are required tocomply with regulatory and other requirements applicable to taxicab and car services, our revenue and growth would be adversely affected.Our business is subject to numerous legal and regulatory risks that could have an adverse impact on our business and future prospects.As  of  December  31,  2021,  our  platform  is  available  in  approximately  10,500  cities  across  approximately  72  countries.  We  are  subject  to  differing,  andsometimes conflicting, laws and regulations in the various jurisdictions in which we provide our offerings.

For example, as we expand our offerings in new areas, such as non-emergency  medicaltransportation, we may be subject to additional healthcare-related federal and state laws and regulations. Additionally, because our offerings are frequently first-to-market in the jurisdictions in which we operate, several local jurisdictions have passed, and we expect additional jurisdictions to pass, laws and regulations thatlimit or block our ability  to offer  our products to Drivers and consumers  in those jurisdictions,  thereby impeding overall  use of our platform.

Further, because a substantial portion of our business involves vehicles that run on fossil fuels, laws, regulations, or governmental actions seeking to curbair pollution or emissions may impact our business. For example, in response to London\u2019s efforts to cut emissions and improve air quality in the city (including theinstitution of a toxicity charge for polluting vehicles in the city center congestion zone and the introduction of an \u201cUltra Low Emissions Zone\u201d that went into effectin April 2019), we have added a clean-air fee of 15 pence per mile to each trip on our platform in London, and plan to help Drivers on our platform fully transitionto electric vehicles by 2025.

We initiated some of these legal challenges to contestthe application of certain laws and regulations to our business. Others have been brought by taxicab owners, local regulators, local law enforcement, and platformusers, including Drivers and consumers. These include individual, multiple plaintiff, and putative class and class action claims for alleged violation of laws relatedto,  among  other  things,  transportation,  competition,  advertising,  consumer  protection,  fee  calculations,  personal  injuries,  privacy,  intellectual  property,  productliability, discrimination, safety, and employment. For example, in May 2019, a class action was filed against us and certain of our subsidiaries in the SupremeCourt of Victoria, Australia on behalf of participants in the taxi, hire-car, limousine, and charter vehicle industry who were licensed to operate in particular regionsof Australia during certain periods between April 2014 and August 2017. The class action alleges that we operated unlawfully in such regions during such periods.These legislative and regulatory proceedings, allegations, and lawsuits are expensive and time consuming to defend, and, if resolved adversely to us, could result infinancial damages or penalties, including criminal penalties, incarceration, and sanctions for individuals employed by us or parties with whom we contract, whichcould harm our ability  to operate  our business as planned in one or more of the jurisdictions  in which we operate,  which could adversely  affect  our business,revenue, and operating results.In addition, while we divested certain assets of our dockless e-bikes and e-scooters business to Lime in May 2020, consumers continue to have access todockless e-bikes and e-scooters through our app. We expect dockless e-bikes and e-scooters to subject us to additional risks distinct from those relating to our otherMobility, Delivery and Freight offerings. For example, consumers using dockless e-bikes or e-scooters face a more severe level of injury in the event of a collisionthan that faced while riding in a vehicle, given the less sophisticated, and in some cases absent, passive protection systems on dockless e-bikes and e-scooters. Theoccurrence of real or perceived quality problems or material defects in current or future dockless e-bikes or e-scooters available via our app could result in negativepublicity, market withdrawals, regulatory proceedings, enforcement actions, or lawsuits filed against us, particularly if consumers are injured.Changes in, or failure to comply with, competition laws could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results.Competition  authorities  closely  scrutinize  us  under  U.S.  and  foreign  antitrust  and  competition  laws.  An  increasing  number  of  governments  are  enforcingcompetition laws and are doing so with increased scrutiny, including governments in large markets such as the EU, the United States, Brazil, and India, particularlysurrounding issues of predatory pricing, price-fixing, and abuse of market power. Many of these jurisdictions also allow competitors or consumers to assert claimsof anti-competitive conduct. For example, complaints have been filed in several jurisdictions, including in the United States and India, alleging that our prices aretoo high (surge pricing) or too low (discounts or predatory pricing), or both. If one jurisdiction imposes or proposes to impose new requirements or restrictions onour  business,  other  jurisdictions  may  follow.  Further,  any  new  requirements  or  restrictions,  or  proposed  requirements  or  restrictions,  could  result  in  adversepublicity or fines, whether or not valid or subject to appeal.In  addition,  governmental  agencies  and  regulators  may,  among  other  things,  prohibit  future  acquisitions,  divestitures,  or  combinations  we  plan  to  make,impose  significant  fines  or penalties,  require  divestiture  of  certain  of our  assets,  or impose  other  restrictions  that  limit  or require  us to modify  our operations,including limitations on our contractual relationships with platform users or restrictions on our pricing models.

In many cases, SCA will require a platform user to engage in additional steps to authenticateeach payment transaction. These additional authentication requirements in EEA or similar requirements, such as tokenization, in other countries may make ourplatform user experience substantially less convenient, and such loss of convenience could meaningfully reduce the frequency with which platform users use ourplatform or could cause some platform users to stop using our platform entirely, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results,and  prospects.  Further,  as  a  result  of  implementing  SCA,  many  payment  transactions  on  our  platform  may  fail  to  be  authenticated  due  to  platform  users  notcompleting  all  necessary  authentication  steps.  Thus,  in  some  cases,  we  may  not  receive  payment  from  consumers  in  advance  of  paying  Drivers  for  servicesreceived  by  those  users.

We have in the past and may in the future,settle claims related to such matters. For example, in September 2018, after investigations and various lawsuits relating to the 2016 Breach, we settled with theAttorneys General of all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia through stipulated judgments and payment in an aggregate amount of $148 million related toour failure to report the incident for approximately one year.

The 2016 Breach has led to, and maycontinue to lead to, additional costly and time-consuming regulatory investigations and litigation from other government entities, as well as potentially materialfines and penalties imposed by other U.S. and international regulators. As another example, the California Public Utilities Commission (the \u201cCPUC\u201d) issued aproposed $59 million fine against us for not producing certain information, including personal information related to incidents disclosed in our 2019 US SafetyReport. We negotiated the total payment to $9.1538", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3455, "end_char_idx": 7342, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4e789852-1884-4ae0-8615-4d5465647e1e": {"__data__": {"id_": "4e789852-1884-4ae0-8615-4d5465647e1e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "41", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "/media/mtl/Volume F/PROJECTS/projects/Func_Call/pdf/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2025-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a78eeee1-9f44-4457-9252-bb2d1306da63", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "41", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "/media/mtl/Volume F/PROJECTS/projects/Func_Call/pdf/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2025-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-28"}, "hash": "c05ab6bb2b25f1950b2406553f5084c4ed6cd9162ea4f81f7f5bafb51290b987", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "8ec441e5-fcae-4b19-b3b0-0519e03a26d8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "53884b73c1929f7866b7391606aee0f3910b2044058939cfd63bec5bb3565b8d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "million ($150,000\n as a fine and $9 million to fund safety initiatives), which was approved by the CPUC in December 2021.

The EU adopted the GDPR in 2016, and it became effective in May 2018. The GDPR applies extraterritorially and imposes stringent requirements forcontrollers and processors of personal data. Such requirements include higher consent standards to process personal data, robust disclosures regarding the use ofpersonal  data,  strengthened  individual  data  rights,  data  breach  requirements,  limitations  on  data  retention,  strengthened  requirements  for  special  categories  ofpersonal  data  and  pseudonymised  (i.e.,  key-coded)  data,  and  additional  obligations  for  contracting  with  service  providers  that  may  process  personal  data.  TheGDPR  further  provides  that  EU  member  states  may  institute  additional  laws  and  regulations  impacting  the  processing  of  personal  data,  including  (i)  specialcategories of personal data (e.g., racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, and religious or philosophical beliefs) and (ii) profiling of individuals and automatedindividual decision-making. Such additional laws and regulations could limit our ability to use and share personal or other data, thereby increasing our costs andharming our business and financial condition. Non-compliance with the GDPR (including any non-compliance by any acquired business) is subject to significantpenalties, including fines of up to the greater of \u20ac20 million or 4% of total worldwide revenue, and injunctions against the processing of personal data. Otherjurisdictions outside the EU are similarly introducing or enhancing privacy and data security laws, rules, and regulations, which will increase our compliance costsand the risks associated with non-compliance. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d), which provides new privacy rights for consumers andnew operational requirements for businesses, went into effect in January 2020. The CCPA includes a statutory damages framework and private rights of actionagainst businesses that fail to comply with certain CCPA terms or implement reasonable security procedures and practices to prevent data breaches. Other U.S.states  have  adopted,  and  likely  will  continue  to  adopt,  similar  laws  that  provide  new  consumer  privacy  rights  and  business  operational  requirements.  Brazilprovides another example, having passed the General Data Protection Law (Lei Geral de Prote\u00e7\u00e3o de Dados Pessoais, or LGPD) in 2018, which is now in effect.These laws may be subject to amendments and regulations that may change over time, or result in additional follow-on laws such as the California Privacy RightsAct (\u201cCPRA\u201d)39", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3416, "end_char_idx": 7405, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d2608a2e-723c-476f-9785-53f223818da5": {"__data__": {"id_": "d2608a2e-723c-476f-9785-53f223818da5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "42", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "/media/mtl/Volume F/PROJECTS/projects/Func_Call/pdf/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2025-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "39ff36bb-b021-4282-a316-945f8b016077", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "42", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "/media/mtl/Volume F/PROJECTS/projects/Func_Call/pdf/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2025-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-28"}, "hash": "cd623214d642fbd7d943f735e9b3c13bdb9decd7f4df3a149993c9514b46f683", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d52a88af-df20-4780-9c5f-39951a284139", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "dc92b6523ad1af0ec4b14fd482d0d38c6fefa902ea75cfe4af086ca7a87b739a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "passed in California in Novembe\nr 2020.Additionally, we are subject to laws, rules, and regulations regarding cross-border transfers of personal data, including laws relating to transfer of personaldata outside the EEA. We rely on transfer mechanisms permitted under these laws, including the EU Standard Contract Clauses. Such mechanisms have receivedheightened regulatory and judicial scrutiny and are undergoing modifications, and a 2020 decision by the Court of Justice of the European Union casts doubt on theadequacy of all of the formerly-approved mechanisms for transferring personal data from countries in the EEA to certain other countries such as the United States.If we cannot rely on existing mechanisms for transferring personal data from the EEA, the United Kingdom, or other jurisdictions, we may be unable to transferpersonal data of Drivers, consumers, or employees in those regions, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.In addition, we may be required to disclose personal data pursuant to demands from government agencies, including from state and city regulators as a requirementfor  obtaining  or  maintaining  a  license  or  otherwise,  from  law  enforcement  agencies,  and  from  intelligence  agencies.

Additional  compliance  requirements  may  compel  us  to  revise  or  expand  our  compliance  program,  including  the  procedures  we  use  to  verify  theidentity of platform users and monitor international and domestic transactions.Drivers may become subject to increased licensing requirements, and we may be required to obtain additional licenses or cap the number of Drivers using ourplatform.Many Drivers currently are not required to obtain a commercial  taxi or livery license in their respective jurisdictions. However, numerous jurisdictions inwhich we operate have conducted investigations or taken action to enforce existing licensing rules, including markets within Latin America and the Asia-Pacificregion, and many others, including countries in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, have adopted or proposed new laws or regulations that require Drivers to belicensed with local authorities or require us or our subsidiaries to be licensed as a transportation company. Local regulations requiring the licensing of us or Driversmay  adversely  affect  our ability  to scale  our business  and operations.  In addition,  it  is possible that  various  jurisdictions  could  impose caps  on the number  oflicensed Drivers or vehicles with whom we may partner or impose limitations on the maximum number of hours a Driver may work, similar to recent regulationsthat were adopted in Spain and New York City, which have temporarily frozen new vehicle licenses for Drivers using platforms like ours. If we or Drivers becomesubject to such caps, limitations, or licensing requirements, our business and growth prospects would be adversely impacted.We may be subject to liability for the means we use to attract and onboard Drivers.We operate in an industry in which the competition for Drivers is intense. In this highly competitive environment, the means we use to onboard and attractDrivers  may  be  challenged  by  competitors,  government  regulators,  or  individual  plaintiffs.  For  example,  putative  class  actions  have  been  filed  by  individualplaintiffs against us for alleged violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, alleging, among other things, that plaintiffs received text messagesfrom us regarding our Driver program without their consent or after indicating to us they no longer wished to receive such text messages. In addition, in early 2017,we settled an investigation by the FTC into statements we made regarding potential Driver earnings and third-party vehicle leasing and financing programs. Inconnection with this matter, we agreed, among other things, to pay $20 million to the FTC for Driver redress. These lawsuits are expensive and time consuming todefend,  and,  if  resolved  adversely  to  us,  could  result  in  material  financial  damages  and  penalties,  costly  adjustments  to  our  business  practices,  and  negativepublicity.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4706, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "30e25b99-45e3-4c1e-a86d-caaa127cc58c": {"__data__": {"id_": "30e25b99-45e3-4c1e-a86d-caaa127cc58c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "43", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "/media/mtl/Volume F/PROJECTS/projects/Func_Call/pdf/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2025-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "adf64cb2-489b-4d87-affe-f04d490d3ddf", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "43", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "/media/mtl/Volume F/PROJECTS/projects/Func_Call/pdf/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2025-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-28"}, "hash": "6cafbfa937278ca0cb88b48d2585ba0cd9dacc0c1fcad1def805dc0d9a45bf3a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "719111f9-fe6b-48a0-b61a-7d369a242135", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "43", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "/media/mtl/Volume F/PROJECTS/projects/Func_Call/pdf/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2025-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-28"}, "hash": "5be4d4c3af1a0ce0b8f01a36e8737cc7495e1cc2592d853c3f100fef70e1098b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "For  example,  putative  class  actions  have  been  filed  by  individualplaintiffs against us for alleged violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, alleging, among other things, that plaintiffs received text messagesfrom us regarding our Driver program without their consent or after indicating to us they no longer wished to receive such text messages.

In addition, we could incur substantial expense and possible loss of revenue if competitors file additional lawsuits or other claims challenging thesepractices.Our business depends heavily on insurance coverage for Drivers and on other types of insurance for additional risks related to our business. If insurancecarriers  change  the  terms  of  such  insurance  in  a  manner  not  favorable  to  Drivers  or  to  us,  if  we  are  required  to  purchase  additional  insurance  for  otheraspects of our business, or if we fail to comply with regulations governing insurance coverage, our business could be harmed.We use a combination of third-party insurance and self-insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary. Insurance related toour Mobility products may include third-party automobile, automobile comprehensive and collision, physical damage, and uninsured and underinsured motoristcoverage. We require Drivers to carry automobile insurance in most countries, and in many cases we also maintain insurance on behalf of Drivers. We rely on alimited number of ridesharing insurance providers, particularly internationally, and should such providers discontinue or increase the cost of coverage, we cannotguarantee that we would be able to secure replacement coverage on reasonable terms or at all. In addition to insurance related to our products, we maintain otherautomobile  insurance  coverage  for  owned  vehicles  and  employee  activity,  as  well  as  insurance  coverage  for  non-automotive  corporate  risks  including  generalliability, workers\u2019 compensation, property, cyber liability, and director and officers\u2019 liability. If our insurance carriers change the terms of our policies in a mannerunfavorable to us or Drivers, our insurance costs could increase. The cost of insurance that we maintain on behalf of Drivers is higher in the United States andCanada than in other geographies. Further, if the insurance coverage we maintain is not adequate to cover losses that occur, we could be liable for significantadditional costs.In addition, we and our captive insurance subsidiary are party to certain reinsurance and indemnification arrangements that41", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3798, "end_char_idx": 6912, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "998320c7-389a-4fdb-bbd2-e95b47fb9de8": {"__data__": {"id_": "998320c7-389a-4fdb-bbd2-e95b47fb9de8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "44", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "/media/mtl/Volume F/PROJECTS/projects/Func_Call/pdf/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2025-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a1756589-4242-4a1c-8fb8-25dedf05c812", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "44", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "/media/mtl/Volume F/PROJECTS/projects/Func_Call/pdf/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2025-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-28"}, "hash": "ea66be2688cc087f8062cbbeb73e74beb1176a14804f9c9b3c808425638b8b0f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "7ef9955f-29c3-4f3e-9985-44ac2966eeda", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0ccfec8f9cb8b017023a306c5f10a33b857cfa2dfaa7664cb064e333ca9e235e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "transfer\n a significant portion of the risk from the insurance provider to us or our captive insurance subsidiary, which could require us to pay out material amountsthat may be in excess of our insurance reserves, resulting in harm to our financial condition.

Such amounts are based on actuarial estimates,historical claim information, and industry data. While management believes that these reserve amounts are adequate, the ultimate liability could be in excess of ourreserves. We also have requirements to post collateral for current and future claim settlement obligations with certain of our insurance carriers, which may have asignificant impact on our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents available for general business purposes.We may be subject to claims of significant liability based on traffic accidents, injuries, or other incidents that are claimed to have been caused by Drivers whouse  our  platform,  even  when  those  Drivers  are  not  actively  using  our  platform  or  when  an  individual  impersonates  a  Driver.  As  we  expand  to  include  moreofferings on our platform, our insurance needs will likely extend to those additional offerings, including Freight. As a result, our automobile liability and generalliability insurance policies and insurance maintained by Drivers may not cover all potential claims related to traffic accidents, injuries, or other incidents that areclaimed to have been caused by Drivers who use our platform, and may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that we could face. Even if these claims donot  result  in  liability,  we  could  incur  significant  costs  in  investigating  and  defending  against  them.

Legislation  has  been  passed  in  many  U.S.  jurisdictions  that  codifies  these  insurance  requirements  with  respect  to  ridesharing.Additional legislation has been proposed in other jurisdictions that seeks to codify or change insurance requirements with respect to ridesharing. Further, serviceproviders and business customers of Freight and Uber for Business may require higher levels of coverage as a condition to entering into certain key contracts withus. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with local laws, rules, and regulations or contractual obligations relating to insurance coverage could result inproceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others.

Our pricing models, including dynamic pricing, havebeen, and will likely continue to be, challenged, banned, limited in emergencies, and capped in certain jurisdictions. For example, we have agreed to not calculateconsumer fares in excess of the maximum government-mandated fares in all major Indian cities where legal proceedings have limited the use of surge pricing.Further, in 2018, Honolulu, Hawaii became the first U.S. city to pass legislation to cap surge pricing if increased rates exceed the maximum fare set by the city.Additional regulation of our pricing models could increase our operating costs and adversely affect our business. Furthermore, our pricing model has been thesubject  of  litigation  and  regulatory  inquiries  related  to,  among  other  things,  the  calculation  of  and  statements  regarding  consumer  fares  and  Driver  earnings(including rates, fees, surcharges, and tolls), as well as the use of surge pricing during emergencies and natural disasters.

Although a significant portion of our assets constituteinvestments in non-controlled entities (including in China), referred to elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as minority-owned affiliates, we believe thatwe are not an investment company as defined by the Investment Company Act. While we intend to conduct our operations such that we will not be deemed aninvestment  company,  such  a  determination  would  require  us  to  initiate  burdensome  compliance  requirements  and  comply  with  restrictions  imposed  by  theInvestment Company Act that would limit our activities, including limitations on our capital structure and our ability to transact with affiliates, which would havean adverse effect on our financial condition. To avoid such a determination, we may be required to conduct our business in a manner that does not subject us to therequirements of the Investment Company Act, which could have an adverse effect on our business. For example, we may be required to sell certain of our assetsand pay significant taxes upon the sale or transfer of such assets.Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common StockThe market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile or may decline steeply or suddenly regardless of our operating performance,and we may not be able to meet investor or analyst expectations.

In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm is required to attest to the effectivenessof  our  internal  control  over  financial  annually.  We  currently  are  required  to  disclose  changes  in  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  that  have  materiallyaffected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting on a quarterly basis.The process of compiling the system and processing documentation necessary to perform the evaluation needed to comply with Section 404 is costly andchallenging, and we may not be able to complete evaluation, testing, and any required remediation in a timely fashion. As our business continues to grow in sizeand complexity, we are improving our processes and infrastructure to help ensure we can prepare financial reporting and disclosures within the timeline requiredfor a public company. During the evaluation and testing process of our internal controls, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control overfinancial reporting, we will be unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective.We cannot assure you that there will not be material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the future, particularly due to high growthofferings (such as with Delivery and Freight), which may cause challenges in consistent performance and timely designing new controls. Any failure to maintaininternal  control  over  financial  reporting  could  severely  inhibit  our  ability  to  accurately  report  our  financial  condition  or  operating  results.  If  we  are  unable  toconclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm determines we have a materialweakness in our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the marketprice of our common stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the stock exchange on which our securities are listed, the SECor other regulatory authorities. Failure to remedy any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain these andother effective control systems, could also restrict our future access to the capital markets.ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTSNot applicable.ITEM 2.

The plaintiff alleges that the Uber entities conspired to injure the group members during theperiod 2014 to 2017 by either directly breaching transport legislation or commissioning offenses against transport legislation by UberX Drivers in Australia. Theclaim alleges, in effect, that these operations caused loss and damage to the class representative and class members, including lost income and decreased value ofcertain taxi licenses. In March, April and October 2020, the same Australian law firm filed four additional class action lawsuits alleging the same claim. We denythese allegations and intend to vigorously defend against the lawsuit.Other Legal ProceedingsWhile  it  is  not  possible  to  determine  the  outcome  of  the  legal  actions,  investigations,  and  proceedings  brought  against  us,  we  believe  that,  except  for  thematters described above, the resolution of all such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity, but could bematerial  to  our  consolidated  results  of  operations  in  any  one  accounting  period.

This risk is enhanced in certain jurisdictions outside the UnitedStates where we may be less protected under local laws than we are in the United States. Although the results of the legal proceedings, claims, and governmentinvestigations in which we are involved cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that the final outcome of these matters is reasonably likely to have amaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operating results. Regardless of final outcomes, however, any such legal proceedings, claims, andgovernment investigations may nonetheless impose a significant burden on management and employees and may come with costly defense costs or unfavorablepreliminary and interim rulings.ITEM 4.

The  COVID-19  pandemic  has  rapidlychanged market and economic conditions globally, impacting Drivers, Merchants, consumers and business partners, as well as our business, results of operations,financial  position,  and  cash  flows.  Various  governmental  restrictions,  including  the  declaration  of  a  federal  National  Emergency,  multiple  cities\u2019  and  states\u2019declarations of states of emergency, school and business closings, quarantines, restrictions on travel, limitations on social or public gatherings, and other measureshave, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on our business and operations, including, for example, by reducing the global demand for Mobility rides.Furthermore, we are experiencing and expect to continue to experience Driver supply constraints, and such supply constraints have been and may continue to beimpacted by concerns regarding the COVID-19 pandemic.COVID-19 Response InitiativesWe continue to prioritize the health and safety of our consumers, Drivers and Merchants, our employees and the communities we serve and continue to believewe will play an important role in the economic recovery of cities around the globe. We are focused on navigating the challenges presented by COVID-19 throughpreserving our liquidity and managing our cash flow by taking preemptive action to enhance our ability to meet our short-term liquidity needs. The pandemic hasreduced the demand for our Mobility offering globally, while accelerating the growth of our Delivery offerings. We have responded to the COVID-19 pandemic bylaunching new, or expanding existing, services or features on an expedited basis, particularly those related to delivery of food and other goods.To comply with social distancing guidelines of national, state and local governments, we have temporarily suspended our shared rides Mobility offering inmost markets, and implemented \u201cleave at door\u201d delivery options for Delivery offerings. Additionally, we have asked that all employees who are able to do so, towork remotely.As  vaccination  rates  increase  in  the  United  States,  we  are  observing  that  consumer  demand  for  Mobility  is  recovering  faster  than  driver  availability,  andconsumer demand for Delivery continues to exceed Courier availability. During the first half of 2021, we announced that we are increasing investments in driverincentives to improve driver availability in the near-term.While we continue to assess the impact from the COVID-19 outbreak, we are unable to accurately  predict the full impact of COVID-19 on our business,results of operations, financial position, and cash flows due to numerous uncertainties, including the severity of the disease, the duration of the outbreak, any futurewaves or resurgences of the virus, variants of the virus, the administration, adoption and efficacy of vaccines in the United States and internationally, additionalactions  that  may  be  taken  by  governmental  authorities,  the  further  impact  on  the  business  of  Drivers,  Merchants,  consumers,  and  business  partners,  and  otherfactors identified in Part I, Item 1A. \u201cRisk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Driver Classification DevelopmentsThe  classification  of  Drivers  is  currently  being  challenged  in  courts,  by  legislators  and  by  government  agencies  in  the  United  States  and  abroad.  We  areinvolved in numerous legal proceedings globally, including putative class and collective class action lawsuits, demands for arbitration, charges and claims beforeadministrative agencies, and investigations or audits by labor, social security, and tax authorities that claim that Drivers should be treated as our employees (or asworkers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist), rather than as independent contractors. Of particular note are proceedings in California, where on May 5,2020, the California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint in San FranciscoSuperior Court (the \u201cCourt\u201d) against Uber and Lyft, alleging that drivers are misclassified, and sought an injunction and monetary damages related to the allegedcompetitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers.On August 10, 2020, the Court issued a preliminary injunction order prohibiting us from classifying Drivers as independent contractors and from violatingvarious wage and hour laws.

Following a stay of the injunction and our unsuccessful appeal of the injunction to a Court of Appeal, we were ordered to comply withthe preliminary injunction. In November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that useplatforms like ours for independent work. Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020. Although our stipulation to dissolve the California Attorney General\u2019spreliminary injunction was granted in April 2021, that litigation remains pending, and we also may face liability relating to periods before the effective date ofProposition 22.In January 2021, a petition was filed with the California Supreme Court by several drivers and a labor union alleging that Proposition 22 is unconstitutional,which was denied. The same drivers and labor union have since filed a similar challenge in California Superior Court, and in August 2021, the court ruled thatProposition 22 is unconstitutional. On September 21, 2021, the State of California filed an appeal of that decision with the California Court of Appeal, and theProtect App-Based Drivers and Services has also filed an appeal.To comply with Proposition 22, we have incurred and expect to incur additional expenses, including expenses associated with a guaranteed minimum earningsfloor for Drivers, insurance for injury protection and subsidies for health care. We do not expect these changes will have a material impact on our business, resultsof operations, financial position, or cash flows.Also of note, on October 28, 2015, a claim by 25 Drivers, including Mr. Y.

The tribunal ruled on October 28, 2016 that the Drivers were workers whenever our appwas switched on and they were ready and able to take trips, based on an assessment of the app in July 2016. The Court of Appeal rejected our appeal in a majoritydecision on December 19, 2018. We appealed to the Supreme Court and a hearing at the Supreme Court took place in July 2020.On  February  19,  2021,  the  Supreme  Court  of  the  UK upheld  the  tribunal  ruling.  Subsequently,  we  initiated  a  historical  claims  settlement  process  for  UKdrivers. Damages may include back pay including holiday pay and minimum wage. Additional claimants have also filed and each claimant will be required to bringtheir own separate action to an employment tribunal to determine whether they met the \u201cworker\u201d classification and if so, how much each claimant will be awarded.On March 16, 2021, we announced that more than 70,000 drivers in the UK will be treated as workers, earning at least the National Living Wage when drivingwith Uber. They will also be paid for holiday time and all those eligible will be automatically enrolled into a pension plan. We have also completed a settlementprocess with drivers in the UK to proactively resolve historical claims relating to their classification under UK law.On June 23, 2021, we received a compliance notice from the UK pension regulator to facilitate our auto-enrollment implementation. The pension regulator hasconfirmed  that  Uber  will  be  required  to  pay  historic  company  contributions,  but  that  we  are  not  required  to  pay  the  driver  component  of  historic  pensioncontributions  unless  we  fail  to  comply  in  which  case  the  amount  equivalent  to  those  contributions  would  be  payable  as  a  penalty.  We  have  completed  theenrollment of eligible drivers in the UK into a pension plan.Our  portal  for  drivers  to  register  for  a  settlement  of  historical  holiday  pay  and  national  minimum  wage  liabilities  closed  on  July  22,  2021  and  we  haveextended offers to all drivers eligible for settlement who are not already represented by an attorney and have made payments to the drivers who accepted our offers.We are currently in mediation with the drivers who are represented by one of three law firms who represent large cohorts of drivers. Compensation hearings willtake place in 2022 for claimants who have not settled their historic claims, where the tribunal will assess our position on the correct approach to working time.In September 2021, a Netherlands court ruled that Mobility drivers are employees within the meaning of the taxi collective bargaining agreement.If, as a result of legislation or judicial decisions, we are required to classify Drivers as employees, workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist, wewould  incur  significant  additional  expenses  for  compensating  Drivers,  including  expenses  associated  with  the  application  of  wage  and  hour  laws  (includingminimum  wage,  overtime,  and  meal  and  rest  period  requirements),  employee  benefits,  social  security  contributions,  taxes  (direct  and  indirect),  and  potentialpenalties.

Delivery Gross Bookings grew66% from 2020, on a constant currency basis, due to an increase in food delivery orders and higher basket sizes as a result of stay-at-home order demand related toCOVID-19, as well as continued expansion across U.S. and international markets. Additionally, we saw an increase in Delivery revenue resulting from an increasein certain Courier payments and incentives that are recorded in cost of revenue, where we are primarily responsible for delivery services and pay Couriers forservices provided. Mobility Gross Bookings grew 36%, on a constant currency basis, from 2020, due to increases in Trip volumes as the business recovers from theimpacts of COVID-19.Revenue was $17.5 billion, or up 57% year-over-year, reflecting the overall growth in our Delivery business and an increase in Freight revenue attributable tothe acquisition of Transplace in the fourth quarter of 2021 as well as growth in the number of shippers and carriers on the network combined with an increase involumes with our top shippers.Net loss attributable to Uber Technologies, Inc. was $496 million, a 93% improvement year-over-year, driven by a $1.6 billion pre-tax gain on the sale of ourATG Business to Aurora, a $1.6 billion pre-tax net benefit relating to Uber\u2019s equity investments, as  well as reductions in our fixed cost structure and increasedvariable cost efficiencies.

We also exited the JUMP business and incurred costsrelated to site closures, asset impairments and write-offs. As a result, during the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized $362 million in total restructuringand related charges in the consolidated statement of operations. Total restructuring and related charges included $248 million of cash settled charges, primarily forseverance and other termination benefits. The remaining costs related to these restructuring activities are expected to be immaterial.These  activities  were  designed  to  generate  an  aggregate  cost  savings  of  at  least  $1.0  billion  annually  when  compared  to  our  original  fourth  quarter  2020planned cost structure, with the largest component of savings resulting from reductions in workforce. We do not believe these cost-saving measures will impair ourability to conduct any of our key business functions. As of December 31, 2021, we achieved these aggregate cost savings when compared to our original fourthquarter 2020 planned cost structure.

Mobility Take Rate was 19.0%, down from 22.9% compared to the same period in 2020, primarily due to an increase in Mobility Driverincentives, as Mobility Driver additions have been outpaced by higher demand recovery in the U.S. and other markets.Mobility  adjusted  EBITDA  profit  increased  primarily  attributable  to  an  increase  in  Mobility  revenue,  partially  offset  by  variable  costs  attributable  to  theoverall growth of the business.Delivery SegmentFor the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020, Delivery revenue increased $4.5 billion, or 114% and Delivery adjustedEBITDA loss improved $525 million, or 60%.Delivery revenue increased primarily attributable to an increase in Delivery Gross Bookings of 66%, on a constant currency basis, driven by an increase infood  delivery  orders  and  higher  basket  sizes  as  a  result  of  stay-at-home  demand  related  to  COVID-19,  combined  with  continued  expansion  across  U.S.  andinternational markets. Take Rate improved to 16.2% from 12.9% compared to the same period in 2020 driven by a decrease in incentive spend combined with anoverall improvement in basket sizes. Additionally, we saw an increase in Delivery revenue and Take Rate resulting from an increase in certain Courier paymentsand incentives that are recorded in cost of revenue, where we are primarily responsible for delivery services and pay Couriers for services provided.Delivery  adjusted  EBITDA  loss  improved,  primarily  attributable  to  an  increase  in  Delivery  revenue,  partially  offset  by  a  $2.6  billion  increase  in  cost  ofrevenue as well as a $710 million increase in consumer promotions, brand marketing, and employee headcount costs.Freight SegmentFor the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020, Freight revenue increased $1.1 billion, or 111% and Freight adjustedEBITDA loss improved $97 million, or 43%.Freight revenue increased primarily attributable  to the acquisition of Transplace in the fourth quarter of 2021. Additionally, the increase in Freight revenue isalso driven by the growth in the number of shippers and carriers on the network combined with an increase in volumes with our top shippers.Freight adjusted EBITDA loss improved, primarily attributable to a $135 million improvement in gross profit as a result of increased load margins, partiallyoffset by an increase in employee headcount costs.(1)\n(2), (3) (4)(1)(2)(3) (4)59", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4249, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "36ec8b4f-5f89-4820-87c2-3c3656643bad": {"__data__": {"id_": "36ec8b4f-5f89-4820-87c2-3c3656643bad", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "62", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "/media/mtl/Volume F/PROJECTS/projects/Func_Call/pdf/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2025-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d3e5e4ab-0eca-4be1-98cb-fca8eb3a277d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "62", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "/media/mtl/Volume F/PROJECTS/projects/Func_Call/pdf/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2025-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-28"}, "hash": "bddcbe0d6926c4ec86f9805220c6af44456b2b52db81ede957e287da1d62d577", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "All Other\nFor  the  year  ended  December  31,  2021  compared  to  the  same  period  in  2020,  All  Other  revenue  decreased  $127  million,  or  94%  and  All  Otheradjusted EBITDA loss improved $450 million, or 98%.All Other revenue and All Other adjusted EBITDA loss improved primarily due to the  favorable impact of the sale of our ATG Business in the first quarter of2021 and the JUMP Divestiture in the second quarter of 2020.Certain Key Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresAdjusted EBITDA and revenue  growth rates in constant currency  are non-GAAP financial  measures.

MAPCs  is the number of unique consumers who completed a Mobility or New Mobility ride or received a Deliveryorder on our platform at least once in a given month, averaged over each month in the quarter. While a unique consumer can use multiple product offerings on ourplatform  in  a  given  month,  that  unique  consumer  is  counted  as  only  one  MAPC.  We  use  MAPCs  to  assess  the  adoption  of  our  platform  and  frequency  oftransactions, which are key factors in our penetration of the countries in which we operate.\nTrips.

An accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires judgment on a significant accountingestimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could havebeen  used,  or  changes  in  the  accounting  estimates  that  are  reasonably  likely  to  occur  periodically,  could  materially  impact  the  reported  amounts  of  assets,liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures in our audited consolidated financial statements. We have based our estimates on historical experience andon  various  other  assumptions  that  are  believed  to  be  reasonable  under  the  circumstances,  the  results  of  which  form  the  basis  for  making  judgments  about  thecarrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Although we believe that the estimates we use are reasonable, due to theinherent uncertainty involved in making those estimates, actual results reported in future periods could differ from those estimates.64", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3500, "end_char_idx": 6038, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c0bd4045-9003-49eb-b2c7-55b8e462acdb": {"__data__": {"id_": "c0bd4045-9003-49eb-b2c7-55b8e462acdb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "67", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "/media/mtl/Volume F/PROJECTS/projects/Func_Call/pdf/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2025-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fcc6ef59-c699-4673-96d8-b3bbcda09d46", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "67", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "/media/mtl/Volume F/PROJECTS/projects/Func_Call/pdf/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2025-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-28"}, "hash": "23312b0bfb9b63727dfd7d352bbdb57732559ff50e3c6152890d02b6e2b0b9c2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "4dcf7620-24b7-4b83-835a-35012a1147a3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9ac34fca460a12efcb55a7dc14c6d608c9dca5b21bb4760a6b055ee0067aa965", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "We\n believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments, estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of ourconsolidated  financial  statements.

Our sole performance obligation in the transaction is to connect Drivers and Merchants withend-users to facilitate the completion of a successful ridesharing trip or delivery. Because end-users access our platform for free, except in certain markets, and wehave no performance obligation to end-users, end-users are not our customers.Judgment is required in evaluating the presentation of revenue on a gross versus net basis based on whether we control the service provided to the end-userand are the principal in the transaction (gross), or we arrange for other parties to provide the service to the end-user and are the agent in the transaction (net). Wehave concluded that we are the agent in most markets as we arrange for Drivers and Merchants to provide the service to the end user in Mobility and Deliverytransactions.  The  assessment  of  whether  we  are  considered  the  principal  or  the  agent  in  a  transaction  could  impact  the  accounting  for  certain  payments  andincentives provided to Drivers and end-users and change the timing and amount of revenue recognized.In certain markets, consumers have the option to pay Drivers cash for trips, and we generally collect our service fee from Drivers for these trips by offsettingagainst any other amounts due to Drivers, including Driver incentives. We have concluded collectability of such amounts is not probable until collected. As such,uncollected service fees for cash trips are not recognized as revenue in our consolidated financial statements until collected.Driver IncentivesWe offer various incentive programs to Drivers. Judgment is required to determine the appropriate classification of these incentives. Incentives provided tocustomers are recorded as a reduction of revenue if we do not receive a distinct service in exchange or cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of the servicereceived. Incentives offered in exchange for specific services, such as referral services are recorded as sales and marketing expenses.End-User Discounts and PromotionsWe offer discounts and promotions to end-users (that are not customers) to encourage use of our platform. Judgment is required to determine the appropriateclassification of these incentives. End-user discounts and promotions are recorded to sales and marketing expenses with the exception of market-wide promotionswhich are recorded as a reduction of revenue.Business CombinationsWe allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired based on their estimatedfair values. The excess of the fair  value of purchase  consideration  over the fair values of these identifiable  assets and liabilities  is recorded as goodwill. Suchvaluations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing certainintangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from acquired advertiser, fleet, merchant, and end-user contracts, acquired technology,and trade names, based on expected future growth rates and margins, attrition rates, future changes in technology and royalty for similar brand licenses, usefullives, and discount rates.Management's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as aresult,  actual  results  may  differ  from  estimates.  Allocation  of  purchase  consideration  to  identifiable  assets  and  liabilities  affects  our  amortization  expense,  asacquired  finite-lived  intangible  assets  are  amortized  over  the  useful  life,  whereas  any  indefinite  lived  intangible  assets,  including  goodwill,  are  not  amortized.During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed,with the corresponding offset to goodwill.

Investments in equity securities without readily determinable fair values are initially recorded at cost andare subsequently adjusted to fair value for impairments and price changes from observable transactions in the same or a similar security from the same issuer.Investments in material available-for-sale debt securities are recorded initially at fair value and subsequently remeasured to fair value at each reporting date withthe changes in fair value recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. We may elect the fair value option for financial instruments and account forinvestments in debt and equity securities at fair value with changes reported in net income (loss) from continuing operations.Investments in privately held equity and debt securities are valued using significant unobservable inputs or data in inactive markets. This valuation requiresjudgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity and are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. In determining the estimatedfair  value  of  our  investments  in  privately  held  companies,  we  utilize  the  most  recent  data  available  including  observed  transactions  such  as  equity  financingtransactions of the investees and sales of the existing shares of the investees\u2019 securities. In addition, the determination of whether an observed transaction is similarto the equity and debt securities held by us requires significant management judgment based on the rights and preferences of the securities.We assess our investment portfolio of privately held equity and debt securities quarterly for impairment. The impairment analysis for investments in equitysecurities includes a qualitative analysis of factors including the investee\u2019s financial performance, industry and market conditions, and other relevant factors. If anequity  investment  is  considered  to  be  impaired  we  will  establish  a  new  carrying  value  for  the  investment  and  recognize  an  impairment  loss  through  ourconsolidated statement of operations. Investments in debt securities are evaluated for impairment quarterly based on whether its fair value has declined below itsamortized cost. In circumstances where we intend to sell, or are more likely than not required to sell the security before it recovers its amortized cost basis, thedifference between the fair value and amortized cost is recognized as a loss in the consolidated financial statement of operations, with a corresponding write-downof the security\u2019s amortized cost. In circumstances where neither condition exists, we then evaluate whether a decline is due to credit-related factors. The factorsconsidered in determining whether a credit loss exists can include the extent to which fair value is less than the amortized cost basis, changes in the credit qualityof the underlying loan obligors, credit ratings actions, as well as other factors. To determine the portion of a decline in fair value that is credit-related, we comparethe present value of the expected cash flows of the security discounted at the security\u2019s effective interest rate to the amortized cost basis of the security. A credit-related impairment is limited to the difference between fair value and amortized cost, and recognized as an allowance for credit loss on the consolidated balancesheet with a corresponding adjustment to net income (loss). Any remaining decline in fair value that is non-credit related is recognized in other comprehensiveincome (loss), net of tax. Improvements in expected cash flows due to improvements in credit are recognized through reversal of the credit loss and correspondingreduction in the allowance for credit loss.Equity Method InvestmentsWe account for investments in the common stock or in-substance common stock of entities that provide us with the ability to exercise significant influence,but not a controlling financial interest, using the equity method.

We make certain judgments and assumptions to determine our reporting units and in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carryingvalues for each of our reporting units. Determination of reporting units is based on a judgmental evaluation of the level at which our segment managers reviewfinancial results, evaluate performance, and allocate resources.Judgment in the assessment of qualitative factors of impairment include, among other factors: financial performance; legal, regulatory, contractual, political,business, and other factors; entity specific factors; industry and market considerations, macroeconomic conditions, and other relevant events and factors affectingthe reporting unit. To the extent we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative testis then performed.Performing  a  quantitative  goodwill  impairment  test  includes  the  determination  of  the  fair  value  of  a  reporting  unit  and  involves  significant  estimates  andassumptions. These estimates and assumptions include, among others, revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows,risk-adjusted discount rates, future economic and market conditions, and the determination of appropriate market comparables.Loss ContingenciesWe  are  involved  in  legal  proceedings,  claims,  and  regulatory,  indirect  tax  examinations,  or  government  inquiries  and  investigations  that  may  arise  in  theordinary course of business. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We record a liability whenwe believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible andthe loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated, we disclose the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.We  review the  developments  in our contingencies  that  could affect  the  amount of the  provisions that  have  been  previously  recorded,  and the matters  andrelated  reasonably  possible  losses  disclosed.

Significant  judgment  is required  to determine  both the probability  and theestimated amount of loss. These estimates have been based on our assessment of the facts and circumstances at each balance sheet date and are subject to changebased on new information and future events.The outcomes of litigation, indirect tax examinations and investigations are inherently uncertain.

The insurance reserves is an estimate of our potential liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, which represents the estimate of theultimate unpaid obligation for risks retained by us and includes an amount for case reserves related to reported claims and an amount for losses incurred but notreported as of the balance sheet date. The estimate of the ultimate unpaid obligation utilizes generally accepted actuarial methods applied to historical claim andloss  experience.  In  addition,  we  use  assumptions  based  on  actuarial  judgment  related  to  claim  and  loss  development  patterns  and  expected  loss  costs,  whichconsider  frequency  trends,  severity  trends,  and  relevant  industry  data.

Adjustments, if any, relating to accidents that occurred in prior years are reflected in the current year results of operations.All estimates of ultimate losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses, and of resulting reserves, are subject to inherent variability caused by the nature of theinsurance claim settlement process. Such variability is increased for us due to limited historical experience and the nature of the coverage provided. Actual resultsdepend upon the outcome of future contingent events and can be affected by many factors, such as claim settlement processes and changes in the economic, legal,and social environments. As a result, the net amounts that will ultimately be paid to settle the liability, and when these amounts will be paid, may vary in the nearterm from the estimated amounts.While management believes that the insurance reserve amount is adequate, the ultimate liability may be in excess of, or less than, the amount provided.Stock-Based CompensationWe have granted stock-based awards consisting primarily of stock options, restricted common stock, RSUs, warrants, and SARs to employees, members ofour board of directors and non-employees. The substantial majority of our stock-based awards have been made to employees. The majority of our outstandingRSUs, as well as certain options, SARs, and shares of restricted common stock, contain a service-based vesting condition. A small portion of the awards containsservice-based vesting condition as well as performance-based vesting condition and/or market-based vesting condition. The service-based vesting condition for themajority of these awards is satisfied over four years. The performance-based vesting condition is satisfied upon meeting predetermined targets of certain financialand operation metrics. The market-based vesting condition is satisfied upon reaching predetermined targets of fully diluted equity values.We account for stock-based employee compensation under the fair value recognition and measurement provisions, in accordance with applicable accountingstandards, which requires compensation expense for the grant-date fair value of stock-based awards to be recognized over the requisite service period. We accountfor forfeitures when they occur.We have elected to use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options, warrants, and SARs on the grant date. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires certain subjective inputs and assumptions, including the fair value of our common stock, the expected term, risk-free interestrates, expected stock price volatility, and expected dividend yield of our common stock.These assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, other than the fair value of our common stock, are estimated as follows:\u2022Expected term.

QUANTITATIVE AND\n QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily include interest rate risk, investment risk, and foreign currencyrisk as follows:Interest Rate RiskOur exposures to market risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to our 2025 Refinanced Term Loan and 2027 Refinanced Term Loan Facilities. The2025 and 2027 Refinanced Term Loan Facilities represent floating rate notes and are carried at amortized cost. Therefore, fluctuations in interest rates will impactour consolidated financial statements. A rising interest rate environment will increase the amount of interest paid on these loans. A hypothetical 100 basis pointincrease or decrease in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial results.The fair value of our fixed rate notes will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and decliningin periods of increasing rates of interest. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of our notes by $317 millionas of December 31, 2021.Investment RiskOur  investment  policy  objective  aims  to  preserve  capital  and  meet  liquidity  requirements  without  significantly  increasing  risk.  We  had  cash  and  cashequivalents including restricted cash and cash equivalents totaling $7.4 billion and $7.8 billion as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Wedid not have any marketable debt securities classified as short-term investments as of December 31, 2021. Our cash and cash equivalents consist of money marketfunds and cash deposits. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Investments in fixed rate securities carry a degree of interest raterisk. Changes in rates would primarily impact interest income due to the relatively short-term nature of our investments. A hypothetical 100 basis point change ininterest rates would not have a material effect on our financial results.We are exposed to certain risk related to the carrying amounts of investments in other companies, including our minority-owned, privately-held affiliates andrecently public companies, compared to their fair value. We hold privately held investments in illiquid private company stock which are inherently difficult tovalue given the lack of publicly available information. We also hold equity securities with readily determinable fair values which are subject to equity price risk.These investments in privately-held affiliates and recently public companies may increase the volatility in our net income/(loss) in future periods due to changes inthe fair value of these investments. In certain cases, our ability to sell these investments may be impacted by contractual obligations to hold the securities for a setperiod of time after a public offering. As of December 31, 2021, the carrying value of our investments was $12.6 billion, including equity method investments.Foreign Currency RiskWe transact business globally in multiple currencies. Our international revenue, as well as costs and expenses denominated in foreign currencies, expose us tothe risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. We are exposed to foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operatingexpenses  denominated  in  currencies  other  than  the  U.S.  dollar.  Accordingly,  changes  in  exchange  rates  may  negatively  affect  our  future  revenue  and  otheroperating results as expressed in U.S. dollars.

A company\u2019s internal control over financialreporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactionsand  dispositions  of  the  assets  of  the  company;  (ii)  provide  reasonable  assurance  that  transactions  are  recorded  as  necessary  to  permit  preparation  of  financialstatements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance withauthorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding71", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3587, "end_char_idx": 6254, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "af4ea65a-f2ca-4e94-91d1-06960bdcd8c0": {"__data__": {"id_": "af4ea65a-f2ca-4e94-91d1-06960bdcd8c0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "74", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "/media/mtl/Volume F/PROJECTS/projects/Func_Call/pdf/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2025-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "54dbafef-66ff-466b-b66a-a13b2ec313ac", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "74", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "/media/mtl/Volume F/PROJECTS/projects/Func_Call/pdf/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2025-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-28"}, "hash": "95a11447794f629f7178adddd0b190b30c94c900dc810da687f63a6536b7bede", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c1f01b0f-b935-42cc-9913-4d9ce0e209a0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3c243db3d263807080adc07e5af13003ab4460a5e7dd9b5e9e05fd07c647b550", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "prevention or timely de\ntection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because  of  its  inherent  limitations,  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  may  not  prevent  or  detect  misstatements.  Also,  projections  of  any  evaluation  ofeffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance withthe policies or procedures may deteriorate.Critical Audit MattersThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicatedor required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and(ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion onthe consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on thecritical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.Presentation of Mobility and Delivery Revenue Agreements, Including Incentives, Discounts and Promotions to Drivers, Merchants and End-UsersAs described in Notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company derives its revenues principally from Drivers\u2019 and Merchants\u2019 use of theCompany\u2019s platform, on-demand lead generation, and related services in connection with Mobility and Delivery services, as well as from direct fees charged toend-users for use of the platform and in exchange for Delivery services. Management applies judgment in determining whether the Company is the principal oragent  in  transactions  with  Drivers,  Merchants  and  end-users.  This  determination  impacts  the  presentation  of  revenue  on  a  gross  or  net  basis  as  well  as  thepresentation of incentives provided to Drivers and Merchants and discounts and promotions offered to end-users, to the extent they are not customers. For the yearended  December  31,  2021,  the  Company\u2019s  Mobility  and  Delivery  revenue,  net  of  incentives,  was  $15.3  billion  and  discounts,  loyalty  programs,  promotions,refunds, and credits provided to end-users who are not customers totaled $2.4 billion, of which a significant portion relates to discounts and promotions.The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the presentation of Mobility and Delivery revenue agreements, includingincentives, discounts and promotions to Drivers, Merchants, and end-users is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management in assessing thepresentation of revenue on a gross or net basis, as well as the presentation of incentives, discounts and promotions offered to Drivers, Merchants, and end-users,which  in  turn  led  to  a  high  degree  of  auditor  judgment,  subjectivity  and  effort  in  performing  procedures  and  evaluating  audit  evidence  relating  to  whethertransaction attributes were appropriately analyzed and presented by management.Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financialstatements.  These  procedures  included  testing  the  effectiveness  of  controls  relating  to  the  Company\u2019s  revenue  recognition  process,  including  controls  over  thepresentation of Mobility and Delivery revenue, incentives, discounts and promotions. These procedures also included, among others, testing, on a sample basis, triptransaction attributes and assessing management\u2019s classification of new or changed agreements by examining documentation related to the agreement terms, driverstatements, rider receipts, and discount, promotion and incentive terms, and assessing the impact of those terms and attributes on the presentation of revenue andincome statement classification.Valuation of Insurance ReservesAs described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, insurance reserves is the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, which representsthe estimate of the ultimate unpaid obligation for risks retained by the Company and includes an amount for case reserves related to reported claims and an amountfor  losses  incurred  but  not  reported  as  of  the  balance  sheet  date.  The  estimate  of  the  ultimate  unpaid  obligation  utilizes  generally  accepted  actuarial  methodsapplied  to historical  claim  and loss experience.  In addition,  management  uses assumptions  based  on actuarial  judgment  related  to claim  and loss developmentpatterns  and  expected  loss  costs,  which  consider  frequency  trends,  severity  trends,  and  relevant  industry  data.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4988, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c1f01b0f-b935-42cc-9913-4d9ce0e209a0": {"__data__": {"id_": "c1f01b0f-b935-42cc-9913-4d9ce0e209a0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "74", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "/media/mtl/Volume F/PROJECTS/projects/Func_Call/pdf/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2025-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "54dbafef-66ff-466b-b66a-a13b2ec313ac", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "74", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "/media/mtl/Volume F/PROJECTS/projects/Func_Call/pdf/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2025-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-28"}, "hash": "95a11447794f629f7178adddd0b190b30c94c900dc810da687f63a6536b7bede", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "af4ea65a-f2ca-4e94-91d1-06960bdcd8c0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "74", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "/media/mtl/Volume F/PROJECTS/projects/Func_Call/pdf/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2025-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-28"}, "hash": "8e4fe2aae1691f3a05f24a3926abd33e9f5287ffb75be5a138d6b0a59bd56a3b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "The  estimate  of  the  ultimate  unpaid  obligation  utilizes  generally  accepted  actuarial  methodsapplied  to historical  claim  and loss experience.

Significant Accounting PoliciesDescription of BusinessUber Technologies, Inc. (\u201cUber,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d or \u201cus\u201d) was incorporated in Delaware in July 2010, and is headquartered in San Francisco, California. Uber isa technology platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, operational excellence and product expertise to power movement from point A to point B.Uber develops and operates proprietary technology applications supporting a variety of offerings on its platform (\u201cplatform(s)\u201d or \u201cPlatform(s)\u201d). Uber connectsconsumers  (\u201cRider(s)\u201d)  with  independent  providers  of  ride  services  (\u201cMobility  Driver(s)\u201d)  for  ridesharing  services,  and  connects  Riders  and  other  consumers(\u201cEaters\u201d)  with restaurants,  grocers  and other stores (collectively,  \u201cMerchants\u201d)  with delivery  service  providers  (\u201cCouriers\u201d)  for meal  preparation,  grocery  andother delivery services. Riders and Eaters are collectively referred to as \u201cend-user(s)\u201d or \u201cconsumer(s).\u201d Mobility Drivers and Couriers are collectively referred toas \u201cDriver(s).\u201d Uber also connects consumers with public transportation networks. Uber uses this same network, technology, operational excellence and productexpertise to connect shippers with carriers in the freight industry. Uber is also developing technologies that will provide new solutions to solve everyday problems.Our technology is used around the world, principally in the United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d) and Canada, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia(excluding China and Southeast Asia).Basis of PresentationThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States(\u201cGAAP\u201d). We consolidate our wholly-owned subsidiaries and majority-owned subsidiaries over which we exercise control, and variable interest entities (\u201cVIE\u201d)where  we  are  deemed  to  be  the  primary  beneficiary.  Refer  to  Note  16  \u2013  Variable  Interest  Entities  for  further  information.  All  intercompany  balances  andtransactions have been eliminated.Use of EstimatesThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions, which affect thereported amounts in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are based on historical experience, where applicable, and other assumptions whichmanagement believes are reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates estimates, including, but not limited to: fair values ofinvestments and other financial instruments (including the measurement of credit or impairment losses); useful lives of amortizable long-lived assets; fair value ofacquired intangible assets and related impairment assessments; impairment of goodwill; stock-based compensation; income taxes and non-income tax reserves;certain deferred tax assets and tax liabilities;  insurance reserves; and other contingent liabilities. These estimates are inherently subject to judgment and actualresults could differ from those estimates. We considered the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the assumptions and inputs (including market data) supportingcertain  of  these  estimates,  assumptions  and  judgments,  in  particular,  our  impairment  assessment  related  to  the  determination  of  the  fair  values  of  certaininvestments and equity method investments as well as goodwill and the recoverability of long-lived assets. The level of uncertainties and volatility in the globalfinancial markets and economies resulting from the pandemic as well as the uncertainties related to the impact of the pandemic on us and our investees' operationsand financial performance means that these estimates may change in future periods, as new events occur and additional information is obtained.Concentration of Credit RiskCash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, restricted cash and cash equivalents, other receivables, and accounts receivable are potentially subject tocredit risk concentration. Cash, cash equivalents, and available-for-sale securities primarily consist of money market funds, cash deposits, U.S. government andagency securities, and investment-grade corporate debt securities. Our investment policy limits the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution orcommercial  issuer. Cash deposits  typically  exceed  insured  limits  and are  placed  with financial  institutions  around the  world that  we believe  are  of high creditquality. We have not experienced any material losses related to these concentrations during the periods presented. Our other receivables primarily consist of fundswithheld by well-established insurance companies with high credit quality that may be used to cover future settlement of reserved insurance claims.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4958, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8c67b788-7347-4386-bbf9-c672de8e517a": {"__data__": {"id_": "8c67b788-7347-4386-bbf9-c672de8e517a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "84", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "/media/mtl/Volume F/PROJECTS/projects/Func_Call/pdf/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2025-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0ef5db6b-0d99-4dca-811a-41d49a622f3f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "84", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "/media/mtl/Volume F/PROJECTS/projects/Func_Call/pdf/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2025-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-28"}, "hash": "3f3ef084dfe6c575ba19bcec4b75b978663f6af72a14519354442607475d15dc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "303b14c5-bfcc-4e58-bce7-fb074e81c4ad", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "84", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "/media/mtl/Volume F/PROJECTS/projects/Func_Call/pdf/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2025-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-28"}, "hash": "f03235045d363e51e17b7e420cf7e0bc7f30d057078046751e73c65aa4288b01", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Cash, cash equivalents, and available-for-sale securities primarily consist of money market funds, cash deposits, U.S. government andagency securities, and investment-grade corporate debt securities.

No customers accounted for 10% or more of revenue for theyears ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021.Certain Significant Risks and UncertaintiesWe  have  incurred  significant  net  losses  since  inception  and  had  an  accumulated  deficit  of  $23.6  billion  as  of  December  31,  2021.

We made a policy election not to separate non-lease components from leasecomponents, therefore, we account for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. We also elected the short-term lease recognition exemption forall leases that qualify.We determine if a contract contains a lease at inception of the arrangement based on whether we have the right to obtain substantially all of the economicbenefits from the use of an identified asset and whether we have the right to direct the use of an identified asset in exchange for consideration, which relates to anasset  which  we  do  not  own.  Right  of  use  (\u201cROU\u201d)  assets  represent  our  right  to  use  an  underlying  asset  for  the  lease  term  and  lease  liabilities  represent  ourobligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets are recognized as the lease liability, adjusted for lease incentives received. Lease liabilitiesare recognized at the present value of the future lease payments at the lease commencement date. The interest rate used to determine the present value of the futurelease  payments  is  our  incremental  borrowing  rate  (\u201cIBR\u201d),  because  the  interest  rate  implicit  in  most  of  our  leases  is  not  readily  determinable.  The  IBR  is  ahypothetical rate based on our understanding of what our credit rating would be to borrow and resulting interest we would pay to borrow an amount equal to thelease payments in a similar economic environment over the lease term on a collateralized basis. Lease payments may be fixed or variable; however, only fixedpayments  or  in-substance  fixed  payments  are  included  in  our  lease  liability  calculation.  Variable  lease  payments  may  include  costs  such  as  common  areamaintenance, utilities, real estate taxes or other costs. Variable lease payments are recognized in operating expenses in the period in which the obligation for thosepayments are incurred.Operating leases are included in operating lease ROU assets, operating lease liabilities, current and operating lease liabilities, non-current on our consolidatedbalance sheets. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, net, accrued and other current liabilities, and other long-term liabilities on our consolidatedbalance sheets. For operating leases, lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis in operations over the lease term. For finance leases, lease expense isrecognized as depreciation and interest; depreciation on a straight-line basis over the lease term and interest using the effective interest method.

We evaluate our reporting units when changes in our operating structure occur, and if necessary, reassigngoodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. In testing for goodwill impairment, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence ofevents  or circumstances  leads to a determination  that it  is more likely  than not that the  fair  value  of a reporting  unit is less than  its carrying  amount. If,  afterassessing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount,then additional impairment testing is not required. However, if we conclude otherwise, we proceed to the quantitative assessment.The quantitative assessment compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its book value, including goodwill. If the fair value exceeds book value,goodwill is considered not to be impaired and no additional steps are necessary. However, if the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairmentloss will be recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.

Our marketable  equity securities  inpublicly traded companies are measured at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recognized in the consolidated statements of operations. Certain investmentsin  non-marketable  equity  securities  are  measured  at  cost,  with  remeasurements  to  fair  value  only  upon  the  occurrence  of  observable  price  changes  in  orderlytransactions for the identical or similar securities of the same issuer, or in the event of any impairment. We reassess at each reporting period to determine whethernon-marketable equity securities have a readily determinable fair value, in which case they would no longer be eligible for fair value measurement alternative.Non-marketable equity securities that we elected to apply the fair value option and equity securities with a readily determinable fair value are measured at fairvalue on a recurring basis with changes in fair value recognized in the consolidated statements of operations. We evaluate our non-marketable equity securities forimpairment at each reporting period based on a qualitative assessment that considers various potential impairment indicators. Impairment indicators might include,but would not necessarily be limited to, a significant deterioration in the earnings performance, credit rating, asset quality, or business prospects of the investee, asignificant adverse change in the regulatory, economic, or technological environment of the investee, a bona fide offer to purchase, an offer by the investee to sell,or  a  completed  auction  process  for  the  same  or  similar  securities  for  an  amount  less  than  the  carrying  amount  of  the  investments  in  those  securities.  If  animpairment  exists,  a  loss  is  recognized  in  the  consolidated  statements  of  operations  for  the  amount  by  which  the  carrying  value  exceeds  the  fair  value  of  theinvestment.

Investments  in  debt  securities  are  classified  as  available-for-sale  and  are  initially  recorded  at  fair  value.  Investments  in  marketable  debt  securitiesinclude commercial paper, U.S. government and agency securities and corporate bonds. As of December 31, 2020, certain investments in non-marketable equitysecurities with redemption, interest, or other debt-like features were classified as available-for-sale debt securities. Subsequent changes in fair value of available-for-sale debt securities are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. We record certain of our debt securities at fair value with the changes in fairvalue recorded in earnings under the fair value option of accounting for financial instruments.As of December 31, 2020, we considered our marketable debt securities as available for use in current operations, including those with maturity dates beyondone year, and therefore classify these securities as short-term investments on the consolidated balance sheet. Certain investments in non-marketable debt securitiesclassified as available-for-sale debt securities were included in investments on the consolidated balance sheet.Allowance for Credit Losses on Available-for-sale Debt SecuritiesWe  account  for  credit  losses  on  available-for-sale  debt  securities  in  accordance  with  ASC  326,  Financial  Instruments  -  Credit  Losses  (\u201cASC  326\u201d).

Incircumstances where neither condition exists, we then evaluate whether a decline is due to credit-related factors. The factors considered in determining whether acredit loss exists can include the extent to which fair value is less than the amortized cost basis, changes in the credit quality of the underlying loan obligors, creditratings actions, as well as other factors. To determine the portion of a decline in fair value that is credit-related, we compare the present value of the expected cashflows of the security discounted at the security\u2019s effective interest rate to the amortized cost basis of the security. A credit-related impairment is limited to thedifference between fair value and amortized cost, and recognized as an allowance for credit loss on the consolidated balance sheet with a corresponding adjustmentto net income (loss). Any remaining decline in fair value that is non-credit related is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. Improvements inexpected cash flows due to improvements in credit are recognized through reversal of the credit loss and corresponding reduction in the allowance for credit loss.Equity Method InvestmentsInvestments in common stock or in-substance common stock of entities that provide us with the ability to exercise significant influence, but not a controllingfinancial interest, over the investee are accounted for under the equity method of accounting, unless the fair value option is elected.

Evidence of a loss in value might include, butwould  not  necessarily  be  limited  to,  absence  of  an  ability  to  recover  the  carrying  amount  of  the  investment  or  inability  of  the  investee  to  sustain  an  earningscapacity that would justify the carrying amount of the investment. This evaluation consists of several qualitative and quantitative factors including recent financialresults and operating trends of the investee; implied values in recent transactions of investee securities; other publicly available information that may affect thevalue of our investments.Evaluation of Long-Lived Assets for ImpairmentWe evaluate our held-and-used long-lived assets for indicators of possible impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amountof an asset or asset group (collectively, the \u201casset group\u201d) may not be recoverable. We measure the recoverability of the asset group by comparing the carryingamount  of  such  asset  groups  to  the  future  undiscounted  cash  flows  it  expects  the  asset  group  to  generate.  If  we  consider  the  asset  group  to  be  impaired,  theimpairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the asset group exceeds its fair value.Fair Value Measurements and Financial InstrumentsFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants atthe measurement date. In accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement (\u201cASC 820\u201d), we use the fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used tomeasure fair value. The hierarchy, as defined below, gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and thelowest priority to unobservable inputs. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are set forth below:    Level 1    Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.Level 2    Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices in markets that arenot active or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly for the full term of the assets or liabilities.Level 3    Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.Our  primary  financial  instruments  include  cash  equivalents,  restricted  cash  and  cash  equivalents,  receivables,  investments,  accounts  payable,  accruedliabilities, long-term debt, and, prior to 2021, marketable debt securities, embedded derivatives and warrants. The estimated fair value of cash equivalents, accountsreceivable,  accounts  payable  and  accrued  liabilities  approximates  their  carrying  value  due  to  the  short-term  maturities  of  these  instruments.  Refer  to  Note  3  \u2013Investments and Fair Value Measurement and Note 8 \u2013 Long-Term Debt and Revolving Credit Arrangements for further information.Variable Interest EntitiesWe evaluate our ownership, contractual and other interests in entities to determine if we have a variable interest in an entity. These evaluations are complex,involve judgment, and the use of estimates and assumptions based on available historical and prospective information, among other factors. If we determine that anentity for which we hold a contractual or ownership interest in is a VIE and that we are the primary beneficiary, we consolidate such entity in the consolidatedfinancial  statements.  The  primary  beneficiary  of  a  VIE  is  the  party  that  meets  both  of  the  following  criteria:  (1)  has  the  power  to  make  decisions  that  mostsignificantly  affect  the  economic  performance  of  the  VIE;  and  (2)  has  the  obligation  to  absorb  losses  or  the  right  to  receive  benefits  that  in  either  case  couldpotentially be significant to the VIE. Periodically, we determine whether any changes in the interest or relationship with the entity impacts the determination ofwhether we are still the primary beneficiary. If we are not deemed to be the primary beneficiary in a VIE, we account for the investment or other variable interestsin a VIE in accordance with applicable GAAP.

The MSA defines the service fee we chargeDrivers and Merchants for each transaction. Upon acceptance of a transaction, Drivers and Merchants agree to perform the services as requested by an end-user.The acceptance of a transaction request combined with the MSA establishes enforceable rights and obligations for each transaction. A contract exists between usand the Drivers and Merchants after the Drivers and Merchants accept a transaction request and the Drivers\u2019 and Merchants\u2019 ability to cancel the transaction lapses.The Uber Service activities are performed to satisfy our sole performance obligation in the transaction, which is to connect Drivers and Merchants with end-users to facilitate the completion of a successful transaction.In 2020, we began charging Mobility end-users a fee to use the platform in certain markets. In these transactions, in addition to a performance obligation toDrivers, we also have a performance obligation to end-users, which is to connect end-users to Drivers in the marketplace. We recognize revenue when a trip iscomplete.  We  present  revenue  on  a  net  basis  for  these  transactions,  as  we  do  not  control  the  service  provided  by  Drivers  to  end-users.  For  the  years  endedDecember 31, 2020 and 2021, we recognized total revenue of $323 million and $336 million, respectively, associated with these fees charged to end-users.Additionally, during the first quarter of 2020, we modified our arrangements in certain markets and as a result, concluded we are responsible for deliveryservices to end-users in those markets. We have determined that in these transactions, Merchants and end-users are our customers and revenue from these contractsshall be recognized separately for each under ASC 606. We recognize delivery service revenue associated with our performance obligation over the contract term,which represents its performance over the period of time the delivery is occurring. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized revenue from end-usersof $91 million and cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization of $439 million associated with these delivery transactions. For the year endedDecember  31,  2021,  we  recognized  revenue  from  end-users  of  $710  million  and  cost  of  revenue,  exclusive  of  depreciation  and  amortization  of  $2.4  billionassociated with these delivery transactions.In all markets aside from the above two scenarios, end-users access the platform for free and we have no performance obligation to end-users. As a result, thisclass of end-users are not our customers.Principal vs. Agent ConsiderationsJudgment is required in determining whether we are the principal or agent in transactions with Drivers, Merchants and end-users. We evaluate the presentationof revenue on a gross or net basis based on whether we control the service provided to the end-user and are the principal (i.e. \u201cgross\u201d), or we arrange for otherparties to provide the service to the end-user and are an agent (i.e. \u201cnet\u201d). This determination also impacts the presentation of incentives provided to Drivers andMerchants and discounts and promotions offered to end-users to the extent they are not customers.For  the  majority  of  Mobility  and  Delivery  transactions,  our  role  is  to  provide  the  Uber  Service  to  Drivers  and Merchants  to  facilitate  a  successful  trip  orDelivery service to end-users.

Drivers and Merchants are our customers and pay us a service fee for each successfullycompleted transaction with end-users.

We recognize revenue when a trip is complete.Depending on the market where the trip is completed, the service fee is either a fixed percentage of the end-user fare or the difference between the amountpaid by an end-user and the amount earned by Drivers. In markets where we earn the difference between the amount paid by an end-user and the amount earned byDrivers, end-users are quoted a fixed upfront price for ridesharing services while we pay Drivers based on actual time and distance for the ridesharing servicesprovided. Therefore, we can earn a variable amount and may realize a loss on the transaction. We typically receive the service fee within a short period of timefollowing the completion of a trip.88", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3557, "end_char_idx": 6324, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "96c24b6c-8138-48f0-ac02-71b205398944": {"__data__": {"id_": "96c24b6c-8138-48f0-ac02-71b205398944", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "91", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "/media/mtl/Volume F/PROJECTS/projects/Func_Call/pdf/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2025-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "caca34b8-0b67-4be7-851d-3d1d4bcc683c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "91", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "/media/mtl/Volume F/PROJECTS/projects/Func_Call/pdf/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2025-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-28"}, "hash": "06d007887aef1ead17c26a308fc5415e367a0afe1653711f836b71ba52ec4b05", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "096009d2-35cf-4741-b20f-29f0532eaf1b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "cb28fdbd1a3ed732304bfe1bec5224c9cbb660f6243e2963870e0ba0d234e61e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "In\n addition, end-users in certain markets have the option to pay cash for trips.

Costsincurred with carriers for Brokerage are recorded in cost of revenue. Shippers contract with us to utilize our network of independent freight carriers to transportfreight.  We  enter  into  contracts  with  Shippers  that  define  the  price  for  each  shipment  and  payment  terms.  Our  acceptance  of  the  shipment  request  establishesenforceable rights and obligations for each contract. By accepting the Shipper's order, we have responsibility for transportation of the shipment from origin todestination. We enter into separate contracts with independent freight carriers and are responsible for prompt payment of freight charges to the carrier regardless ofpayment  by  the  Shipper.  We  invoice  the  Shipper  upon  satisfaction  of  our  sole  performance  obligation  to  transport  a  Shipper\u2019s  freight  using  our  network  ofindependent freight carriers. We recognize revenue associated with our performance obligation over the contract term, which represents our performance over theperiod of time a shipment is in transit. While the transit period of our contracts can vary based on origin and destination, contracts still in transit at period end arenot material. Payment for our services is generally due within 30 to 45 days upon receipt of invoice.Transportation ManagementWe  provide  an  integrated  logistics  and  transportation  service,  which  can  include  shipment  planning,  freight  optimization,  carrier  assignment,  loadmanagement, freight audit and payment processing and other related transportation services. Our sole performance obligation in these contracts is the integration ofthese services to transport the Shipper\u2019s freight on a shipment-by-shipment basis.

For each contract entered into with a Shipper wherewe are responsible for identifying and directing independent freight carriers to transport the Shipper's goods, we control the service before it is transferred to theShipper. We are primarily responsible for fulfilling the contract with the Shipper, including having discretion in selecting a qualified independent freight carrierthat meets the Shipper's specifications.

Users contracted with us via a rental agreement at the inception of each trip. We wereresponsible for providing access to the e-bikes and e-scooters over the user\u2019s desired period of use.

The two-class method requires income available tocommon stockholders for the period to be allocated between common stock and participating securities based upon their respective rights to receive dividends as ifall income for the period had been distributed.Our restricted common stock, and common stock issued upon early exercise of stock options are participating securities. We consider restricted common stockand any shares issued upon early exercise of stock options, subject to repurchase, to be participating securities because holders of such shares have non-forfeitabledividend rights in the event a cash dividend is declared on common stock.Prior  to  conversion  to  common  stock  upon  our  IPO,  the  holders  of  the  redeemable  convertible  preferred  stock  would  have  been  entitled  to  dividends  inpreference to common shareholders, at specified rates, if declared. Then any remaining earnings would be distributed to the holders of common stock, restrictedcommon  stock,  common  stock  issued  upon  early  exercise  of  stock  options,  and  the  holders  of  the  redeemable  convertible  preferred  stock  on  a  pro-rata  basisassuming conversion of all redeemable convertible preferred stock into common stock.

These observed inputswere considered indicative of changes in the fair value of the Grab securities. Using the analysis, we computed a downward market adjustment of 10% that wasapplied  to  the  valuation  derived  from  Grab\u2019s  latest  financing  transaction  which  occurred  earlier  in  the  first  quarter  of  2020  and  prior  to  the  announcement  ofCOVID-19  as  a  global  pandemic,  impacting  global  demand  for  Mobility  services.  As  a  result,  the  carrying  value  of  the  investment  in  Grab  was  reduced  by$230 million; $57 million reduced the previously recognized unrealized gain in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, and the remaining $173 million,representing the difference between the fair value and amortized cost of the securities, was recognized as an allowance for credit loss in the consolidated balancesheet  and  a  corresponding  credit-related  impairment  charge  recorded  to  other  income  (expense),  net  in  the  consolidated  statement  of  operations.  Due  to  thesignificant  uncertainty  about Grab\u2019s ability  to repay the redemption  amount of the securities  on the redemption date, the amount expected to be collected  wasconsidered to be less than the fair value of the securities. Therefore, during the first quarter of 2020, the entire decline in fair value below amortized cost wasconsidered to reflect a credit-related impairment charge.The fair value of our Grab investment recovered during the third quarter of 2020 as determined by referencing an equity financing transaction closed by theinvestee during that quarter.

This evaluation  consists  of  several  factors  including,  but  not limited  to,  an assessment  of a  significant  adverse  change  in  the  economicenvironment,  significant  adverse  changes  in  the  general  market  condition  of  the  geographies  and  industries  in  which  our  investees  operate,  and  other  publiclyavailable information that affect the value of our non-marketable equity securities. As a result of the deterioration in economic and market conditions arising fromCOVID-19, we determined an impairment indicator existed as of March 31, 2020 and the fair value of certain investments, primarily our investment in Didi, wasless than their carrying value.To determine the fair value of our investment in Didi as of March 31, 2020, we utilized a hybrid approach, incorporating a CSE method along with an OPM,weighted  at  80%  and  20%,  respectively.  The  CSE  method  assumes  an  if-converted  scenario,  where  the  OPM  approach  allocates  equity  value  to  individualsecurities  within  the  investees\u2019  capital  structure  based  on  contractual  rights  and  preferences.  We  computed  a  range  of  market  adjustments  based  on  observedmarket valuation declines of Didi\u2019s representative stock market indices and publicly-traded competitive peer group since the latest transaction in similar securitiesoccurred in the prior year and prior to the announcement of COVID-19 as a global pandemic, impacting global demand for ridesharing services. These inputs areconsidered indicative of changes in the fair value of Didi equity. Market adjustments within the range were applied to the Didi equity valuation derived from thelatest financing transaction in similar securities which were then used in the CSE and OPM approaches to obtain the fair value of the Didi securities owned by us.A lower adjustment within the range was applied to the enterprise value used in the CSE allocation compared to a higher downward adjustment for purposes ofallocating value in the OPM approach. The value adjustment differential was attributable to several factors including possible exit scenarios, as an IPO event wouldresult  in  higher  valuation  (due  to  access  to  public  markets  and  reduction  in  cost  of  capital),  reduces  valuation  uncertainty,  and  generally  assumes  market  andmacro-economic conditions that are comparatively more favorable than an otherwise prolonged stay-private scenario. As a result of the valuation performed, werecorded an impairment charge of $1.7 billion in other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of operations during the first quarter of 2020.

In  exchange  for  consideration  contributed,  wereceived a seat on MLU B.V.\u2019s board and an initial 38% equity ownership interest consisting of common stock in MLU B.V. Certain contingent equity issuancesof MLU B.V. may dilute our equity ownership interest to approximately 33%. The investment was determined to be an equity method investment due to our abilityto exercise significant influence over MLU B.V. The initial fair value of our equity method investment in MLU B.V. was estimated using discounted cash flows ofMLU B.V. The equity ownership interest in MLU B.V. was 35% and 29% as of December 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively.2020During 2020, Yandex contributed its Yandex.Carsharing business (\u201cDrive\u201d) into MLU B.V. in exchange for an additional equity interest. The contribution ofDrive into MLU B.V. resulted in the dilution of our ownership in MLU B.V. from 38% to 35%. The gain recognized on the dilution of our interest was not materialto our consolidated results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020. As part of this transaction, MLU B.V. contributed the assets and liabilities of itsautonomous driving unit into a new legal entity, Yandex Self Driving Group B.V. (\u201cSDG\u201d), in which Yandex contributed additional capital. The reduction of ourownership interest to 20% in SDG, initially valued at $42 million, did not result in a material dilution gain.2021On August 30, 2021, we entered into an agreement with Yandex (the \u201cFramework Agreement\u201d) to restructure our joint ventures, MLU B.V. and SDG and wewould sell to Yandex (i) our 4.5% equity interest in MLU B.V. and (ii) our entire equity interest in SDG (the \u201cInitial Closing\u201d).

As a result, we derecognized our entire equity interest in the Demerged Businesses and recognized again of $242 million in other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of operations.MLU B.V. Call OptionThe MLU B.V. Call Option is recorded as a liability in accrued and other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet, initially valued at $230 millionand measured at fair value on a recurring basis with changes in fair value recorded in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. Theexercise  price  of  the  MLU  B.V.  Call  Option  is  approximately  $1.8  billion,  subject  to  certain  adjustments  based  on  the  timing  of  the  option  exercise.  As  ofDecember 31, 2021, the fair value of the MLU B.V. Call Option is $193 million, including the recognition of an immaterial gain for the fair value change duringthe year ended December 31, 2021. To determine the fair value of the MLU B.V. Call Option as of December 31, 2021, we used a lattice model which simulatedmultiple scenarios of the exercise behaviors and the corresponding strike prices over the term of the call option. Key inputs to the lattice model were underlyingbusiness value, option term of 1.7 years, volatility of 50%, risk-free interest rates, and strike price (Level 3).MLU B.V. Basis DifferenceIncluded in the carrying value of MLU B.V. is the basis difference, net of amortization, between the original cost of the investment and our proportionateshare of the net assets of MLU B.V. The carrying value of the equity method investment is primarily adjusted for our share in the income or losses of MLU B.V.and amortization of basis differences. Equity method goodwill and intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization are also adjusted for currency translationadjustments representing fluctuations between the functional currency of the investee, the Ruble and the U.S. Dollar.The table below provides the composition of the basis difference as of December 31, 2021 (in millions):As of December 31, 2021 Equity method goodwill$ 545 Intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization54 Deferred tax liabilities(12) Cumulative currency translation adjustments(107) Basis difference$ 480 We amortize the basis difference related to the intangible assets over the estimated useful lives of the assets that gave rise to the difference using the straight-line method. The weighted-average life of the intangible assets is approximately 4.0 years and 3.3 years as of December 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively. Equitymethod  goodwill  is not  amortized.  The  investment  balance  is reviewed  for  impairment  whenever  factors  indicate  that  the  carrying  value  of the  equity  methodinvestment may not be recoverable. As of December 31, 2020 and 2021, we determined that there was no impairment of our investment in MLU B.V. The futureeffect of the COVID-19 pandemic and related government actions as well as other factors will continue to be monitored.Mission Bay 3 & 4The Mission Bay 3 & 4 JV refers to Event Center Office Partners, LLC (\u201cECOP\u201d), a joint venture entity established in 2018, by Uber and two companies(\u201cLLC Partners\u201d) to manage the construction and operation of two office buildings owned by two ECOP wholly-owned subsidiaries.

As a result, we performed an interim goodwill impairment test by comparingthe fair value of the New Mobility reporting unit to its carrying value. Fair value was determined by referencing market valuation multiples implied by companiesthat have comparable businesses which is a Level 3 measurement.

The difference of $243 million between the principal amount of the 2025 Convertible Notes and the liabilitycomponent (the \u201cdebt discount\u201d) was amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the 2025 Convertible Notes. The equitycomponent  of  the  2025  Convertible  Notes  was  included  in  additional  paid-in  capital  in  the  consolidated  balance  sheet  as  of  December  31,  2020  and  was  notremeasured as it continued to meet the conditions for equity classification. To determine the fair value of the liability component of the 2025 Convertible Notes asof the pricing date, we used the binomial model with inputs of time to maturity, conversion ratio, our stock price, risk free rate and volatility.Effective January 1, 2021, we early adopted ASU 2020-06 using the modified retrospective approach. The adoption of this standard resulted in a decrease toadditional paid-in capital of $243 million and an increase to our 2025 Convertible Notes by the same amount. At adoption, there was no adjustment recorded to theopening accumulated deficit. As a result of the adoption, starting on January 1, 2021 interest expense is reduced as a result of accounting for the 2025 ConvertibleNotes as a single liability measured at its amortized cost.The fair value of our 2025 Convertible Notes was $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2021 and was determined based on quoted prices in markets that are notactive, which is considered a Level 2 valuation input.Senior NotesIn October 2018, we issued five-year notes with aggregate principal amount of $500 million due on November 1, 2023 (the \u201c2023 Senior Notes\u201d) and eight-year  notes  with  aggregate  principal  amount  of  $1.5  billion  due  on  November  1,  2026  (the  \u201c2026  Senior  Notes\u201d)  in  a  private  placement  offering  totaling  $2.0billion.

The current year tax expense and any subsequent changes in the recognition ormeasurement of this deferred tax liability will be recorded in continuing operations.Based on available evidence, management believes it is not more-likely-than-not that the net U.S., Netherlands, and other non-material jurisdictions\u2019 deferredtax assets will be fully realizable. In these jurisdictions, we have recorded a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets. We regularly review the deferredtax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing taxable temporarydifferences  and  tax  planning  strategies  by  jurisdiction.  Our  judgment  regarding  future  profitability  may  change  due  to  many  factors,  including  future  marketconditions and the ability to successfully execute our business plans and/or tax planning strategies. Should there be a change in the ability to recover deferred taxassets, our income tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed. We had a valuation allowance against net deferredtax  assets  of  $13.4  billion  and  $13.9  billion  as  of  December  31,  2020  and  2021,  respectively.  In  2021,  the  increase  in  the  valuation  allowance  was  primarilyattributable to a tax rate increase in the Netherlands, an increase in U.S. federal, state and Netherlands deferred tax assets resulting from the loss from operations,and  tax  credits  generated  during  the  year,  offset  partially  by  the  release  of  the  valuation  allowance  due  to  deferred  tax  liabilities  recorded  as  a  result  of  theacquisitions providing an additional source of taxable income to support the realizability of pre-existing deferred tax assets.The  indefinite  carryforward  period  for  net  operating  losses  (\"NOLs\")  means  that  indefinite-lived  deferred  tax  liabilities  can  be  considered  as  support  forrealization of deferred tax assets, which can affect the need to record or maintain a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. As of December 31, 2020 and 2021,we realized approximately $744 million and $1.2 billion, respectively, of our U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets as a result of our indefinite-lived deferredtax liabilities being used as a source of income.As  of  December  31,  2021,  we  had  U.S.  federal  NOL  carryforwards  of  $3.2  billion  that  begin  to  expire  in  2031  and  $11.7  billion  that  have  an  unlimitedcarryover period.

As of December 31, 2020 and 2021,we  had  recorded  aggregate  liabilities  of  $1.8  billion  and  $2.2  billion,  respectively,  of  which  $1.3  billion  and  $1.3  billion  relate  to  non-income  tax  matters,respectively,  in  accrued  and  other  current  liabilities  on  the  consolidated  balance  sheets  for  all  of  our  legal,  regulatory  and  non-income  tax  matters  that  wereprobable and reasonably estimable.We  are  currently  party  to  various  legal  and  regulatory  matters  that  have  arisen  in  the  normal  course  of  business  and  include,  among  others,  allegedindependent contractor misclassification claims, Fair Credit Reporting Act (\u201cFCRA\u201d) claims, alleged background check violations, pricing and advertising claims,unfair  competition  claims,  intellectual  property  claims,  employment  discrimination  and  other  employment-related  claims,  Telephone  Consumer  Protection  Act(\u201cTCPA\u201d) claims,  Americans  with Disabilities  Act (\u201cADA\u201d) claims,  data  and privacy  claims,  securities  claims,  antitrust  claims,  challenges  to regulations,  andother matters. We have existing litigation, including class actions, Private Attorney General Act lawsuits, arbitration claims, and governmental administrative andaudit  proceedings,  asserting  claims  by  or  on  behalf  of  Drivers  that  Drivers  are  misclassified  as  independent  contractors.  In  connection  with  the  enactment  ofCalifornia State Assembly Bill 5 (\u201cAB5\u201d), we have received and expect to continue to receive - in California and in other jurisdictions - an increased number ofmisclassification claims. With respect to our outstanding legal and regulatory matters, based on our current knowledge, we believe that the ultimate amount orrange of reasonably  possible loss will not, either  individually  or in the aggregate,  have a material  adverse  effect  on our business, financial  position, results  ofoperations, or cash flows. The outcome of such legal matters is inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. If one or more of these matterswere  resolved  against  us  for  amounts  in  excess  of  management's  expectations,  our  results  of  operations,  financial  condition  or  cash  flows  could  be  materiallyadversely affected.Driver ClassificationCalifornia Attorney General LawsuitIn January 2020, AB5 went into effect. AB5 codifies a test to determine whether a worker is an employee under California law. The test is referred to as the\u201cABC\u201d test, and was originally handed down by the California Supreme Court in Dynamex Operations v. Superior Court in 2018. Under the ABC test, workersperforming  services  for  a  hiring  entity  are  considered  employees  unless  the  hiring  entity  can  demonstrate  three  things:  the  worker  (A)  is  free  from  the  hiringentity\u2019s control, (B) performs work that is outside the usual course of the hiring entity\u2019s business, and (C) customarily engages in the independent trade, work ortype of business performed for the hiring entity.On May 5, 2020, the California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint inSan Francisco Superior Court against Uber and Lyft, Inc. (\u201cLyft\u201d). The complaint alleges drivers are misclassified, and seeks an injunction and monetary damagesrelated to the alleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers.On August 10, 2020, the Court issued a preliminary injunction order, prohibiting us from classifying drivers as independent contractors and from violatingvarious wage and hour laws.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4148, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "95852302-5080-4833-af6e-99dba378fc97": {"__data__": {"id_": "95852302-5080-4833-af6e-99dba378fc97", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "129", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "/media/mtl/Volume F/PROJECTS/projects/Func_Call/pdf/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2025-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5dfa057b-c538-4b36-8f3e-530df3609195", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "129", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "/media/mtl/Volume F/PROJECTS/projects/Func_Call/pdf/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2025-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-28"}, "hash": "b91c5c1dc20827f18f84d1527a741fd9db1a476d8e5a23dbcce801b78cc04cb8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "31c86c92-1c4d-42e6-8825-ec397061ccc7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "129", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "/media/mtl/Volume F/PROJECTS/projects/Func_Call/pdf/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2025-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-28"}, "hash": "abafd19ca2d50abc83be30ca2fefd31460ecfa8481da2800e3a0ec8808e6781f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "(\u201cLyft\u201d).

We are challenging each of them before the Social Security and Administrative Tribunals. In April 2021, aruling was made that Uber Switzerland could not be held liable for social security contributions. The litigations with regards to Uber B.V. and Raiser OperationsB.V. are still  pending for  years  2014 to 2019. In January  2022, the  Social Security  Tribunal  of Zurich  reclassified  drivers  who have  used the App in 2014 asdependent workers of Uber BV and Rasier Operations BV from a social security standpoint, but this ruling has been appealed before the Federal Tribunal and hasno impact on our current operations.

The Court of Appeal rejected our appeal in a majority decision on December 19, 2018. We appealed to the Supreme Court and a hearing atthe Supreme Court took place in July 2020.On February 19, 2021, the Supreme Court of the UK upheld the tribunal ruling that the Drivers using the App in 2016 were workers for UK employment lawpurposes. Damages include back pay including holiday pay and minimum wage, which will be assessed and quantified at a future hearing in July 2022.On March 16, 2021, we announced that more than 70,000 Mobility drivers in the UK will be treated as workers, earning at least the National Living Wagewhen driving with Uber. They will also be paid for holiday time and all those eligible will be automatically enrolled into a pension plan. We have also completed asettlement process with drivers in the UK to proactively resolve historical claims relating to their classification under UK law. Our portal for drivers to register fora  settlement  of  historical  holiday  pay  and  national  minimum  wage  liabilities  closed  on  July  22,  2021  and  we  have  extended  offers  to  all  drivers  eligible  forsettlement who are not already represented by an attorney and have made payments to the drivers who accepted our offers.

Webelieve that our current and historical approach to classification is supported by the law and intend to continue to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters.However, the results of litigation and arbitration are inherently unpredictable and legal proceedings related to these claims, individually or in the aggregate, couldhave a material impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Regardless of the outcome, litigation and arbitration of thesematters can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs individually and in the aggregate, diversion of management resources and otherfactors.State Unemployment TaxesIn  2018,  the  New  Jersey  Department  of  Labor  (\u201cNJDOL\u201d)  opened  an  audit  reviewing  whether  Drivers  were  independent  contractors  or  employees  forpurposes of determining whether unemployment insurance regulations apply from 2014 through 2018. The NJDOL made an assessment on November 12, 2019,against both Rasier and Uber. Both assessments were calculated through November 15, 2019, but only calculated the alleged contributions, penalties, and interestsowed from 2014 through 2018.

Levandowski & Ron; Google v. LevandowskiOn October 28, 2016, Google filed arbitration demands against each of Anthony Levandowski and Lior Ron, former employees of Google, alleging breach oftheir  respective  employment  agreements  with  Google,  fraud  and  other  state  law  violations  (due  to  soliciting  Google  employees  and  starting  a  new  venture  tocompete with Google\u2019s business in contravention of their respective employment agreements). Google sought damages, injunctive relief, and restitution. On March26, 2019, following a hearing, the arbitration panel issued an interim award, finding against each of Google\u2019s former employees and awarding $127 million againstAnthony Levandowski and $1 million for which both Anthony Levandowski and Lior Ron are jointly and severally liable. In July 2019, Google submitted itsrequest for interest, attorneys fees, and costs related to these claims. The Panel\u2019s Final Award was issued on December 6, 2019. On February 7, 2020, Ron andGoogle entered into a settlement agreement and mutual release to satisfy the corrected final award in the amount of approximately $10 million. Uber paid Googleon behalf of Ron pursuant to an indemnification obligation. A dispute continues to exist with regard to Uber\u2019s alleged indemnification obligation to Levandowski.Whether Uber is ultimately responsible for indemnification of Levandowski depends on the exceptions and conditions set forth in the indemnification agreement.In March 2020, Levandowski pleaded guilty to criminal trade secret charges and filed for bankruptcy. Former President Trump pardoned Levandowski from thetrade secret conviction. Uber filed a proof of claim in the bankruptcy court, and Levandowski additionally asserted a claim against Uber alleging that Uber failed toperform its obligations under an agreement with Otto Trucking, LLC.

The subject matter of these contingent liabilities and non-income tax audits primarily arises from our transactions with Drivers, as well asthe tax treatment of certain employee benefits and related employment taxes. In jurisdictions with disputes connected to transactions with Drivers, disputes involvethe  applicability  of  transactional  taxes  (such  as  sales,  value  added  and  similar  taxes)  to  services  provided,  as  well  as  the  applicability  of  withholding  tax  onpayments made to such Drivers.We are involved in a proceeding in the UK involving HMRC, the tax regulator in the UK, which is seeking to classify us as a transportation provider. Beingclassified  as  a  transportation  provider  would  result  in  a  VAT  (20%)  on  Gross  Bookings  or  on  the  service  fee  that  we  charge  Drivers,  both  retroactively  andprospectively. HMRC is considering a number of factors including our contractual Driver, Rider and intercompany arrangements, and HMRC is also expected toconsider the U.K. Supreme Court\u2019s February 19, 2021 ruling on Drivers\u2019 worker classification, in determining whether we should be classified as a provider oftransportation services. HMRC may update its assessment, which we would then review and discuss with HMRC. If we do not reach a satisfactory resolution afterexhausting HMRC\u2019s review and appeals process, we would still be able to argue our case anew in the U.K. Tax Court, which may require the up-front payment tothe Tax Court (\u201cpay-to-play\u201d) of any final HMRC assessment to be held in escrow. We continue to believe that we have meritorious defense in these proceedings.Our  estimated  liability  is  inherently  subjective  due  to  the  complexity  and  uncertainty  of  these  matters  and  the  judicial  processes  in  certain  jurisdictions,therefore, the final outcome could be different from the estimated liability recorded.129", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3552, "end_char_idx": 6295, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "84f7b2f0-bef4-4220-982c-e159834ae012": {"__data__": {"id_": "84f7b2f0-bef4-4220-982c-e159834ae012", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "132", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "/media/mtl/Volume F/PROJECTS/projects/Func_Call/pdf/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2025-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-28"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4c83bb2a-c056-4acc-9d1f-cee604ae8101", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "132", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "/media/mtl/Volume F/PROJECTS/projects/Func_Call/pdf/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2025-06-28", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-28"}, "hash": "bd5a81dfac9accb57125332df6e47d0ee93b6496f7ea5227c2091b518e069392", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "49c3a4d4-17ce-42b8-9402-cdf1af60d471", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "aaa13568cd12eca650a4e0a74a272c910504e835b7e70b236054da3b301f723b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Other Legal and Regulatory Matters\nWe  have  been  subject  to  various  government  inquiries  and  investigations  surrounding  the  legality  of  certain  of  our  business  practices,  compliance  withantitrust,  Foreign  Corrupt  Practices  Act  and  other  global  regulatory  requirements,  labor  laws,  securities  laws,  data  protection  and  privacy  laws,  consumerprotection  laws,  environmental  laws,  and  the  infringement  of  certain  intellectual  property  rights.

The redeemable non-controllinginterest of Freight Holding is not accreted to redemption value because it is currently not probable that the non-controlling interest will become redeemable.Holders of Common Stock of Freight HoldingThe minority common stockholders of our subsidiary Freight Holding, including any holders of common equity awards issued under the employee equityincentive plans and employees who hold fully vested shares, have put rights to sell certain of their equity interests at fair value to us at specified periods of timethat terminates upon the earliest of the closing of a liquidation transaction or an IPO of the subsidiary. Should the put rights be exercised, they can be satisfied ineither cash, Uber stock, or a combination of cash and Uber stock based upon our election. As of December 31, 2020 and 2021, the minority common stockholdersownership in Freight Holding is classified as a redeemable non-controlling interest, because it is redeemable on an event that is not solely in our control.We attribute the pro rata share of the Freight Holding\u2019s net income or loss available to holders of common stock to the redeemable non-controlling interestsgenerated from common shares of Freight Holding based on the outstanding ownership of the minority shareholders of common shares during the period.Freight Series A Preferred StockIn October 2020, Freight Holding entered into a 2020 Freight Series A Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement with a 2020 Freight Series A Investor.

Revenue for the period from January 2, 2020through December 31, 2020 were not material.CornershopIn 2019, as a strategic move of entering into grocery delivery market, we agreed to purchase a controlling interest in Cornershop Cayman (\u201cCornershop\u201d),operating an online grocery delivery platform primarily in Chile and Mexico. During 2019, we made an initial investment of $50 million (the \u201cInitial CornershopInvestment\u201d). The remaining investment was subject to antitrust approval of the countries where Cornershop operates.During the second quarter of 2020, we received regulatory approvals, except for Mexico. As a result, we and Cornershop amended the terms of the agreementin order for Uber to acquire Cornershop\u2019s business operations, except for those in Mexico. Immediately prior to the transaction close, Cornershop was restructuredsuch that the Mexico operations were held in Cornershop Technologies LLC and its wholly owned subsidiary (collectively referred to as \u201cCS-Mexico\u201d), while allof the remaining Cornershop operations were to be held in the newly created CS-Global entity.On July 6, 2020, we acquired 55% controlling interest in CS-Global, an entity which held all of Cornershop\u2019s business operations, except for those in Mexico.This transaction resulted in an Uber direct capital contribution of $200 million, which included the Initial Cornershop Investment and notes receivable, to CS-Global and a payment of $179 million to tendering shareholders, paid in a combination of cash and 2,055,038 shares of our common stock. The Initial CornershopInvestment was remeasured immediately prior to the acquisition of CS-Global, and based on the Cornershop business value and Uber\u2019s pre-acquisition ownershippercentage, the new value was not materially  different from the previously recognized amount. Thus, the Initial Cornershop Investment was determined at theoriginal $50 million. In exchange for the consideration transferred, we received 15,642,523 Preferred C Membership Interests in CS-Global, representing 55% ofthe  outstanding  membership  interests.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURESEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and ProceduresWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports that wefile or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the timeperiods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management,including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As required by Rule13a-15(b)  under  the  Exchange  Act,  our  management,  including  our  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  Chief  Financial  Officer,  evaluated  the  effectiveness  of  ourdisclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief ExecutiveOfficer  and  Chief  Financial  Officer  concluded  that,  as  of  the  end  of  the  period  covered  by  this  Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K,  our  disclosure  controls  andprocedures are effective at a reasonable assurance level.Changes in Internal Control over Financial ReportingThere were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2021 that have materially affected,or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of ControlsOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal controlover financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and are effective at the reasonable assurance level. However, ourmanagement does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and fraud.Any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that itsobjectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all controlissues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected.Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial ReportingOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under theExchange Act). Our management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria established in\u201cInternal Control - Integrated Framework\u201d (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (\u201cCOSO\u201d). Based on thatassessment,  our  management  has  concluded  that  our  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  was  effective  as  of  December  31,  2021.  In  addition,PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, provided an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting asof December 31, 2021. You can find the full text of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP attestation report in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.In accordance with guidance from the staff of the SEC, companies are permitted to exclude acquisitions from their final assessment of internal control overfinancial reporting for the first fiscal year in which the acquisition occurred. Our management\u2019s evaluation of internal control over financial reporting excluded theinternal control activities of The Drizly Group, Inc.
