# ðŸ”¢ Arithmetic Reasoning (Multi-step)
# "Add 15 and 27, subtract 10, and then multiply the result by 2"

# "Multiply 12 by 4, then subtract 5, and finally add 8"

# "First subtract 50 from 200, then divide the result by 10 and multiply it by 6"

# (Note: You'll need a divide tool for this to work! Want help adding it?)

# "Add 25 to 75, multiply the result by 2, then subtract 30"

# ðŸ§  Nested Expressions
# "Add 8 and 6, then multiply that result by the sum of 3 and 4"

# "If you multiply 5 and 6, and then add that to 100, whatâ€™s the total?"

# ðŸ¤¯ Reasoning with Decoys (Test agentâ€™s choice)
# "Can you just tell me the result of 7 + 8, or do you need to use tools?"

# "Multiply 7 and 9, then just tell me what 100 minus that is"

# ðŸ§ª Experimental (With invalid/misleading parts)
# "Add banana and 12, then multiply that by apple"

# (should trigger fallback or error gracefully)

# "Add 50 to 30 and then, you know, just magic multiply by the stars!"

# (tests natural language robustness)
